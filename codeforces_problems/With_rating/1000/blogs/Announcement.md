Hi Codeforces!

For our programming boot campâ€™s next iteration of [Hello Barcelona Programming Bootcamp](http://in.harbour.space/icpc/acm-icpc-hello-barcelona-bootcamp-autumn-2018?utm_source=partners&utm_medium=codeforces), [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) in collaboration with Moscow Workshops ICPC, ITMO University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Saint Petersburg State University and Codeforces is bringing the best training practices and coaches to Barcelona to prepare 150 students for winning medals in the next **ICPC World Finals**.

Our boot camp will once again feature the all-time greats Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov, Andrey [andrewzta](https://codeforces.com/profile/andrewzta "Grandmaster andrewzta") Stankevich, Michael [Endagorion](https://codeforces.com/profile/Endagorion "International Grandmaster Endagorion") Tikhomirov, Gleb [GlebsHP](https://codeforces.com/profile/GlebsHP "International Grandmaster GlebsHP") Evstropov, Artem [VArtem](https://codeforces.com/profile/VArtem "International Grandmaster VArtem") Vasilyev, Ivan [ifsmirnov](https://codeforces.com/profile/ifsmirnov "Grandmaster ifsmirnov") Smirnov and other world renowned Russian coaches to train the participants.

Expect the most challenging problems, surprise guests and speakers, a branded hackathon, and finally the online round held on Codeforces, so everyone can join the onsite participants, at the finale of the event.
