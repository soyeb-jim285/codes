You are given a quantum oracle - an operation on *N* + 1 qubits which implements a function ![](images/ca923da5e61e139eb5596a3b9e34cc7ef42d1433.png). You are guaranteed that the function *f* implemented by the oracle can be represented in the following form (oracle from problem D2):

![](images/b2eb3d0e407b200708fe5e4dc65e777bc2c88984.png)Here ![](images/b27ec8b8056386de828da0df174348afa7d29512.png) (a vector of *N* integers, each of which can be 0 or 1), and ![](images/823bed8a1021f190960cf0b721fad709b7641d0e.png) is a vector of *N* 1s.

Your task is to reconstruct the array ![](images/71fa108edb785ca9f729fa3cd5ad18556dd682e4.png) which could produce the given oracle. Your code is allowed to call the given oracle only once.

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:

* an integer *N* - the number of qubits in the oracle input (1 ≤ *N* ≤ 8),
* an oracle *Uf*, implemented as an operation with signature ((Qubit[], Qubit) => ()), i.e., an operation which takes as input an array of qubits and an output qubit and has no output.

The return of your operation is an array of integers of length *N*, each of them 0 or 1.

Note that in this problem we're comparing the oracle generated by your return to the oracle *Uf*, instead of comparing your return to the (hidden) value of ![](images/71fa108edb785ca9f729fa3cd5ad18556dd682e4.png) used to generate *Uf*. This means that any kind of incorrect return results in "Runtime Error" verdict, as well as actual runtime errors like releasing qubits in non-zero state.

Your code should have the following signature:


```text
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;  
  
    operation Solve (N : Int, Uf : ((Qubit[], Qubit) => ())) : Int[]  
    {  
        body  
        {  
            // your code here  
        }  
    }  
}
```
