# Announcement

Hi everybody!

Summer... It is a wonderful time for traveling, walking with friends, new discoveries and, of course, writing new exciting contests at Codeforces. Thus, I bring to your attention my new Codeforces Round #495 (Div. 2) with interesting tasks that will take place on [Thursday, July 5, 2018 at 22:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=5&month=7&year=2018&hour=19&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). If your rating is less than 2100, this round will be rated for you; otherwise, you can participate out of competition.

I would like to thank Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for his help with problems preparing and for Codeforces and Polygon platforms. Also, Ildar [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq") Gainullin, Dmitry [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "International Master cdkrot") Sayutin, Daniil [danya.smelskiy](https://codeforces.com/profile/danya.smelskiy "International Master danya.smelskiy") Smelskiy, Chin-Chia [eddy1021](https://codeforces.com/profile/eddy1021 "International Grandmaster eddy1021") Hsu, and Kevin [ksun48](https://codeforces.com/profile/ksun48 "International Grandmaster ksun48") Sun for the problems testing. 

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. Scoring distribution will be announced later.

In this round, you will have to help Sonya with her daily problems. Good luck!
