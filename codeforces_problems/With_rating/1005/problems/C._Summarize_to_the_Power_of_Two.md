A sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is called good if, for each element $a_i$, there exists an element $a_j$ ($i \ne j$) such that $a_i+a_j$ is a power of two (that is, $2^d$ for some non-negative integer $d$).

For example, the following sequences are good:

* $[5, 3, 11]$ (for example, for $a_1=5$ we can choose $a_2=3$. 
## Note

 that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for $a_2$ and $a_3$),
* $[1, 1, 1, 1023]$,
* $[7, 39, 89, 25, 89]$,
* $[]$.

## Note

 that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of $0$) is good.

For example, the following sequences are not good:

* $[16]$ (for $a_1=16$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two),
* $[4, 16]$ (for $a_1=4$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two),
* $[1, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8]$ (for $a_3=2$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two).

You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.

###### Input

The first line contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 120000$) â€” the length of the given sequence.

The second line contains the sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).

###### Output

Print the minimum number of elements needed to be removed from the given sequence in order to make it good. It is possible that you need to delete all $n$ elements, make it empty, and thus get a good sequence.

## Examples

###### Input


```text
6  
4 7 1 5 4 9  

```
###### Output


```text
1  

```
###### Input


```text
5  
1 2 3 4 5  

```
###### Output


```text
2  

```
###### Input


```text
1  
16  

```
###### Output


```text
1  

```
###### Input


```text
4  
1 1 1 1023  

```
###### Output


```text
0  

```
## Note

In the first example, it is enough to delete one element $a_4=5$. The remaining elements form the sequence $[4, 7, 1, 4, 9]$, which is good.
