# Announcement

Hello!

Finally I am freed from the big part of summer cares and I can continue the preparation of Div. 3 rounds! I decided to add something written by me to this blog because [TryToKnowMe](https://codeforces.com/profile/TryToKnowMe "Pupil TryToKnowMe") (and many others, i think) [noticed](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/60377?#comment-442051) that i am really copy and paste this text from one announcement to another changing only contest name and start time. But... Who knows, may be this time which is saved by copy-pasting the announcement allows me to prepare the problems better?... Let it stay a mystery. So, let's go.

[Codeforces Round 498 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1006 "Codeforces Round 498 (Div. 3)") will start at [Monday, July 16, 2018 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=7&year=2018&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). You will be offered 6 problems with expected difficulties to compose an interesting competition for participants with ratings up to 1600. Probably, participants from the first division will not be at all interested by this problems. And for 1600-1899 the problems will be too easy. However, all of you who wish to take part and have rating 1600 or higher, can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks. I tried to make strong tests â€” just like you will be upset if many solutions fail after the contest is over.

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them.

Note that **the penalty** for the wrong submission in this round (and the following Div. 3 rounds) is **10 minutes**.

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the *trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participants of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a *trusted participant of the third division* or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**
