Hello, everyone!

We are a Death Metal band [Skyglow](https://codeforces.com/http://skyglowband.com/). Recently we released our first album. And since we happen to be sport programmers, we decided to make a Codeforces round in honor of this!

The round will take place on [Friday, July 13, 2018 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=13&month=7&year=2018&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). There will be five problems for each division, three of them will coincide. The problems were made up by me and [rembocoder](https://codeforces.com/profile/rembocoder "Master rembocoder"), the contest was also prepared with the help of [TeaPot](https://codeforces.com/profile/TeaPot "Grandmaster TeaPot"), [slavik](https://codeforces.com/profile/slavik "International Master slavik"), [mingaleg](https://codeforces.com/profile/mingaleg "Candidate Master mingaleg") and [niyaznigmatul](https://codeforces.com/profile/niyaznigmatul "International Grandmaster niyaznigmatul"). Thanks to [demon1999](https://codeforces.com/profile/demon1999 "International Grandmaster demon1999") and [winger](https://codeforces.com/profile/winger "International Grandmaster winger") for testing, our coordinator [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") and, of course, [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for Codeforces and Polygon platforms.
