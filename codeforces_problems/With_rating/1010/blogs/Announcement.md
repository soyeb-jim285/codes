# Announcement

I invite you to participate in the **rated** [Codeforces Round #499](https://codeforces.com/contests/1010,1011). Date and time of the round: [Thursday, July 26, 2018 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=26&month=7&year=2018&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166).

Those whose rating is not less than 1900 can participate in the round **Div.1**. Other can participate in the round **Div.2**.

Do not skip this contest, because the next Codeforces Round (Div.1, Div.2, or Div.3), which number begins with the digit '4', will be through the 3501 rounds!

This is the first competition I proposed. I hope that you will enjoy it.

The round will have **6 problems** for each division **(4 problems are common)**. The contest will last for **2 hours**.

The main heroine of the competition is astronaut Natasha, Mars researcher. If you solve all problems, her flight will pass successfully.

Five problems of the contest are invented by me, Vladislav Zavodnik ([VladProg](https://codeforces.com/profile/VladProg "Master VladProg")), problems Div2.A and Div2.B are invented by Mike Mirzayanov ([MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov")), and problem Div1.F is invented by Ildar Gainullin ([300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Grandmaster 300iq")) and Dmitry Sayutin ([cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "International Master cdkrot")).
