# Announcement

Hello everybody!

On July 28 and 30 will take place tours of [EJOI](https://codeforces.com/http://ejoi2018.org) â€” individual programming competition for juniors, held under the rules of the International Olympiad in Informatics.

EJOI consists of the most interesting and hard problems that are proposed by a wide community of authors, and that is why we decided to give you an opportunity to crack the complete problemset of the contest. During the second tour of Olympiad, we are going to conduct a rated Codeforces round based on problems of both days of our Olympiad.

**We kindly ask all the community members that are going to participate in the competition to show sportsmanship by not trying to cheat in any manner, in particular, by trying to figure out problem statements from the onsite participants. If you end up knowing some of the problems of EJOI (by participating in it, from some of the onsite contestants or in any other way), please do not participate in the round. We also ask onsite contestants to not discuss problems in public. Failure to comply with any of the rules above may result in a disqualification.**

The round will happen at [Monday, July 30, 2018 at 14:15UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=30&month=7&year=2018&hour=11&min=15&sec=0&p1=166) and will last for 2.5 hours. There will be 6 problems in each division.
