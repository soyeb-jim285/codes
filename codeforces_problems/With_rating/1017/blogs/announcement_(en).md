> This round is in memory of Leopoldo Taravilse.
> 
> Leopoldo Taravilse (ltaravilse) was a distinguished member of the competitive programming community in Argentina and Latin America. As a contestant, he reached the ACM-ICPC World Finals in 2010 and 2012, and was active in CodeForces and TopCoder. After 2012 he became a problemsetter for the ACM-ICPC South American regionals and the Argentinian Programming Tournament, and later coach for a World Finalist team in 2016.
> 
> Leopoldo's passion was helping others realize their full potential in competitive programming. He taught at various competitive programming schools in Brazil, Cuba, Peru and Bolivia, and his role organizing the Argentinian Training Camp cannot be overstated. Under his wing, it grew from a small group of friends in 2010 to a major event featuring international sponsors and having hundreds of participants coming from all corners of Latin America. Through successive editions of the Training Camp, Leopoldo inspired students to learn and improve, to give back to the community, and to have fun doing it.
> 
> With his intelligence, warm heart, relentless work ethics and witty sense of humour Leopoldo touched countless lives. We will miss him as a friend, a mentor, a teammate, a drinking buddy, a role model, an overall great person.
> 
> Rest in peace my dear Leo.
