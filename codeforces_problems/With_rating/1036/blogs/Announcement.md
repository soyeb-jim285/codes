Hi Codeforces! 

We are excited to announce our Work & Study Programme, geared towards diving into the worlds of [Computer Science](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/courses/computer-science), [Data Science](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/courses/data-science), and Robotics, while kick starting a fulfilling paid internship with one of our industrial partners!

**Required Education:**

Degree in Robotics or Computer, Electrical, Mechanical Engineering or related disciplines

**Qualifications and skills:**

 * Hands-on robotic programming
* Ideally experience within the automotive manufacturing sector
* Knowledge understanding of robot control interface with ancillary equipment
* Use of robot simulation packages
* Deep experience with all things robotic, from infrastructure-free autonomy, to ROS, computer vision, and machine learning
* Experience working with robot parts and components, developing robotics devices
* Ability to concurrently manage multiple diverse and often complex issues and / or projects at the nexus of software, sensors, and hardware

**If you are interested in this opportunity, [APPLY HERE!](https://codeforces.com/https://harbourspace.typeform.com/to/opyeER)**

**Should you be selected, we will invite you to a series of interviews with admissions, and our industrial partners.** 

Our programmes are both fundamental and practical. Upon joining, you start working with professionals from admired technology, design and communications companies. You will have strong technical and academic support, alongside industrial experience.
