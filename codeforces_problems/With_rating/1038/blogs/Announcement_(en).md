Hi everyone!

It has been almost 2 years since I joined Codeforces, and it has been a great journey as a contestant. I now try to take a shot at problem-setting with my friend [Mahir83](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mahir83 "Expert Mahir83").

With that said, I bring to your attention my new [Codeforces Round 508 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1038 "Codeforces Round 508 (Div. 2)") that will take place on [Thursday, September 6, 2018 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=9&year=2018&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). If your rating is less than 2100, this round will be rated for you; otherwise, you can participate out of competition.

I would like to thank [Mahir83](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mahir83 "Expert Mahir83") for his help with preparing problems, [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") & [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq") for coordinating my round and [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik"), [craborac](https://codeforces.com/profile/craborac "International Grandmaster craborac"), [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "International Grandmaster vintage_Vlad_Makeev"), [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Candidate Master vovuh") & [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "Grandmaster BledDest") for testing my problems. I would also like to thank [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. Scoring distribution will be announced later.

Good luck!
