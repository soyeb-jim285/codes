# Announcement

Hello, community!

Codeforces Round #509 will be held on [Sunday, September 16, 2018 at 16:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=9&year=2018&hour=13&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for Div. 2 contestants. There will be 6 problems for 2 hours. **Please, notice that the start time is unusual.**

**The round will be rated for the div. 2 participants. The statements will be available in Russian and English languages.**

The round will start 2 hours after the start of the Qualification Stage, so they will finish around same time. That's why we ask the participants of the Quals to stay silent and don't share the statements of the contest with anyone. Unfortunately, we cannot add all the problems from Quals to the round, it will contain only six problems.

The problems for the official contest were prepared by the guys from the jury in the person of Alex [fcspartakm](https://codeforces.com/profile/fcspartakm "Candidate Master fcspartakm") Frolov, Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "Master adedalic") Dalabaev, Ivan [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "Grandmaster BledDest") Androsov and me.

We also would like to express our gratitude to Anton [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") Tsypko for coordination of the round and Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for the permission to make a mirror and Codeforces and Polygon platforms.
