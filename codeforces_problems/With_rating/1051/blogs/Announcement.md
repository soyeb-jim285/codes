**UPD2:** We investigated the issue to get the following results. 10 people were noticeably affected (that took them more than 3 minutes of the working time). Round will surely be rated for other participants. As for the affected participants, we will look into the rating changes and revert them in case they are negative (set the participant into the unofficial participation mode).

**UPD3:** [Editorial is out](Tutorial.md)
