The problems were authored and prepared by Codeforces team: me, Dmitry [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") Sayutin, Ildar [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq") Gainullin and Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov, and also Maxim [Neon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Neon "Candidate Master Neon") Mezhcheryakov. Huge thanks to Grigory [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "Specialist vintage_Vlad_Makeev") Reznikov abd Kamil [Errichto](https://codeforces.com/profile/Errichto "International Grandmaster Errichto") Debowski for problems' testing!

This round is the final in the new championship called [Mail.Ru Cup](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62355), you can learn more about it following the link. The round will be rated for everybody!

After the round we will know who will get the following prizes:

 * First place — **Apple MacBook Air**
* Second and third place — **Apple iPad**
* Fourth, fifth, sixth places — **Samsung Gear S3**
* Traditionally, the top **100** championship participants will get cool **T-shirts**!

In each round, top 100 participants get prize points according to the [table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT). The championship's result of a participant is the sum of the two largest results he gets on the three rounds. The results of the two first rounds are published [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/63096). In case of ties in the top six places, they will be broken by the sum of in-round scores in the corresponding (best for the participant) two rounds.

There will be eight problems and two and a half hours to solve them.

Good luck!
