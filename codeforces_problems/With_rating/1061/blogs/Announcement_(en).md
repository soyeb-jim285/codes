Hi everyone!

I would like to invite you to my second Codeforces Round, which I have made with my friend and Snackdown partner [Jeel_Vaishnav](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jeel_Vaishnav "Master Jeel_Vaishnav").

With that said, I bring to your attention our new [Codeforces Round 523 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1061 "Codeforces Round 523 (Div. 2)") that will take place on [Thursday, November 22, 2018 at 21:45UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=22&month=11&year=2018&hour=18&min=45&sec=0&p1=166). If your rating is less than 2100, this round will be rated for you; otherwise, you can participate out of competition.

I would really like to thank [Jeel_Vaishnav](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jeel_Vaishnav "Master Jeel_Vaishnav") for his help with preparing problems, [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") for coordinating our round and [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik"), [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "International Grandmaster vintage_Vlad_Makeev"), [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "Master Aleks5d"), [KeyurJain](https://codeforces.com/profile/KeyurJain "Candidate Master KeyurJain") & [Mahir83](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mahir83 "Candidate Master Mahir83") for testing the problems. I would also like to thank [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. Scoring distribution will be announced later.
