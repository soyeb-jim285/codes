# Announcement_(en)

Hi everyone. I'm glad to announce that the [Codeforces Round 520 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1062 "Codeforces Round 520 (Div. 2)") will be held on [Wednesday, November 14, 2018 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=14&month=11&year=2018&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The round will be **rated for Div 2 participants (whose ratings are lower than 2100)**. However, all the other participants can compete as well, without worrying about ratings being changed.

You will be given 2 hours to solve 6 problems. It's better to read all the problems. The scoring distribution will be announced soon before the contest starts.

All the problems were prepared by myself, with some help from my friend [GiraffeCoder](https://codeforces.com/profile/GiraffeCoder "Candidate Master GiraffeCoder"). I want to thank [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") for coordinating me in preparing the problems, [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "Expert vintage_Vlad_Makeev"), [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27"), [demon1999](https://codeforces.com/profile/demon1999 "Grandmaster demon1999") and [Arpa](https://codeforces.com/profile/Arpa "Master Arpa") for testing my solutions. I also want to thank [csacademy](https://codeforces.com/profile/csacademy "Unrated, csacademy") for their graph editor tool. You can check it out at [this link](https://codeforces.com/https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/).

This is the first round I propose. I put a lot of work into it so I hope that you will enjoy it (smiley face).

Wish you do your best and get a high rating!
