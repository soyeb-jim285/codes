I would like to invite you to participate in the rated [Codeforces Round #518](https://codeforces.com/contests/1067,1068). Date and time of the round: [Wednesday, October 24, 2018 at 18:05](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html..). The round was postponed from October 23 to October 24 because of the ICPC Indian Online Qualifier. 

This is the first competition I proposed. I hope you will enjoy it. 

The round will have 6 tasks for the second division and 5 tasks for first (3 problems are common). The contest will last for 2 hours. 

Tasks for you were prepared by Alexey [kristevalex](https://codeforces.com/profile/kristevalex "Expert kristevalex") Kristev and Alexey [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik") Danilyuk. Also thanks for:

 **slight lyrical digression**After a lot of stupid questions...

This round is a thanks-round for support from Mail.Ru during the 8-year campaign!
