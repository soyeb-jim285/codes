On [Monday, November 12, 2018 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=12&month=11&year=2018&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) [Educational Codeforces Round 54 (Rated for Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1076 "Educational Codeforces Round 54 (Rated for Div. 2)") will start.

Series of Educational Rounds continue being held as [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) initiative! You can read the details about the cooperation between [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) and Codeforces in the [blog post](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/51208).

This round will be **rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100**. It will be held on extented ACM ICPC rules. The penalty for each incorrect submission until the submission with a full solution is 10 minutes. After the end of the contest you will have 12 hours to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.

You will be given **7 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them.

The problems were invented and prepared by Roman [Roms](https://codeforces.com/profile/Roms "Master Roms") Glazov, Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "Master adedalic") Dalabaev, Vladimir [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Candidate Master vovuh") Petrov, Ivan [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "Grandmaster BledDest") Androsov and me.

Good luck to all participants!

**UPD2**: There was an error in problem D which caused some incorrect solutions to get accepted. We will investigate the number of users who were affected by this issue and decide whether the round is rated.

**UPD3**: We discussed the issue and came up with the following decision:

Those who got accepted earlier and get WA now won't be affected by rating changes. For everyone else (for those who got correct verdict) the contest will be rated.

**UPD4**: [Editorial is out](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/63151)
