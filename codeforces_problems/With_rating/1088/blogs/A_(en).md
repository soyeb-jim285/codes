Hi!

I'm back with a new contest, a new color, and a new batch of xor problems.

Codeforces round #525, rated for the second division, is taking place on [Tuesday, December 4, 2018 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=12&year=2018&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). As usual, first division participants can take part out of competition.

I'm the problemsetter of the round. I'd like to thank [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq") for the great effort coordinating the round, [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27"), [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot"), [budalnik](https://codeforces.com/profile/budalnik "International Grandmaster budalnik"), and [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "Pupil vintage_Vlad_Makeev") for testing the round, [scanhex](https://codeforces.com/profile/scanhex "Grandmaster scanhex") for translating the statements to Russian, [mahmoudbadawy](https://codeforces.com/profile/mahmoudbadawy "Candidate Master mahmoudbadawy") for giving his opinions about the problems, and [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great codeforces and polygon platforms.

Like my previous [round](https://codeforces.com/contest/959), you'll be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them.

After the contest, I'll be on the [community Discord server](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) to discuss the problems.

**UPD**: the scoring distribution will be 500-1000-1500-2000-2500-3000.

**UPD**: something wrong happened and the editorial was deleted. I'll post it as soon as possible :(

**UPD**: the [editorial](Tutorial_(en).md) has been re-written.

Good luck & Have fun!

**UPD**: congratulations to the winners!
