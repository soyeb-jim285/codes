# Good_Bye_2018_(en)

The end of the December is fast approaching and it is time for the best last contest of the year! The Good Bye 2018 round will take place on [Sunday, December 30, 2018 at 14:35 UTC](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=30&month=12&year=2018&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

As the people who already engaged in [discussions about the ultimate problem](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/64025) suspect, I am the problem writer. As such, I'd like to thank to:

 * [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") and [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for the round coordination and one of the problems,
* [AlexFetisov](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlexFetisov "Master AlexFetisov"), [cyand1317](https://codeforces.com/profile/cyand1317 "Grandmaster cyand1317"), [Errichto](https://codeforces.com/profile/Errichto "International Grandmaster Errichto"), [Jeel_Vaishnav](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jeel_Vaishnav "Master Jeel_Vaishnav"), [Lewin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lewin "International Grandmaster Lewin"), [misof](https://codeforces.com/profile/misof "Master misof"), [winger](https://codeforces.com/profile/winger "International Grandmaster winger") for testing and invaluable suggestions,
* [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") and everyone involved in building and running Codeforces and Polygon platform.

The round will last for 2:30 hours and you will be given 8 problems for both divisions. There will be an [interactive problem](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).
