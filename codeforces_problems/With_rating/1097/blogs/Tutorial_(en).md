### [1097A - Gennady and a Card Game](../problems/A._Gennady_and_a_Card_Game.md "Hello 2019")

The task is to check if some card in the second line has a common character with the card in the first line. The best way to do this is to create a single string for the card in the hand and an array of strings for the cards on the table.

After reading the input, just iterate with a loop over the array. If a string in the array has any common character with the single string, then output "YES". If no similarity was found, output "NO".
