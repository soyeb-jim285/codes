Hello coders! I hope that you are enjoying the New Year as much as me. To make its beginning even greater, Codeforces is going to host a contest and I will be an author of all tasks. Hello 2019 will take place on [Friday](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=1&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

Using the opportunity, I want to thank to:

 * [Lewin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lewin "International Grandmaster Lewin") and [mnbvmar](https://codeforces.com/profile/mnbvmar "Legendary Grandmaster mnbvmar") for testing the round.
* [mnbvmar](https://codeforces.com/profile/mnbvmar "Legendary Grandmaster mnbvmar") for indescribably helpful discussions about problems.
* [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") and [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for round coordination and help with preparation.
* [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for such great platforms (you know which ones :P).

The round will consist of 8 problems and you will be given ~~two and a half~~ three hours to solve them. Yes, the round will be **rated**.

There will be no interactive problems, but if you want you can read [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) document anyway, it's always good to learn new things.

Good luck and see you during the contest!

**UPD1:** [Editorial](https://codeforces.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

**UPD2:** I'll be on the [Discord](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) channel after the contest, so you will be able to ask me about the problems.

**UPD3:** You're probably wondering what the statements will be about. I hope that it will be another great year for Codeforces. As it's the community that creates it, I decided to write statements about the people who already have or had their part in Codeforces' history. As I wanted to be objective, the statements will be about 8 people who triumphed the most times in CF rounds. Using the opportunity, I want to invite these 8 people to take part in the contest. Let's say that the first person who will guess the set in the comments wins some free contribution. Good luck!

**UPD4:** The round will be **3 hours** long.

**UPD5:** The drain will be adjusted and the scoring will be **500-1000-1500-2000-2750-3000-3500-4000**.

**UPD6:** The round is over, congratulations to the winners!
