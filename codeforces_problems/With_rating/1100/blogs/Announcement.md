# Announcement

Hi, Codeforces!

At [Sunday, January 13, 2019 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=13&month=1&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) will start [Codeforces Round 532 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1100 "Codeforces Round 532 (Div. 2)"). Round will be rated for second division (rating below 2100). As usual, participants from the first division can participate in a contest out of competition.

The round will consist of 6 problems and you will be given two hours to solve them.

Task prepared by me, [den2204](https://codeforces.com/profile/den2204 "Master den2204").

P.S. It is my first round on Codeforces, please, do not judge strictly :)

**UPD:** Added [editorial](Tutorial_1.md). Thank you all for participating and for the feedback on the contest. I apologize for the leap in complexity between tasks and for weak pretests for some tasks, Iâ€™ll take this into account when further preparing contests.
