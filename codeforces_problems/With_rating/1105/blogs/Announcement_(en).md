Hi, Everyone!

At [Sunday, January 20, 2019 at 18:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=20&month=1&year=2019&hour=15&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) will start [Codeforces Round 533 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1105 "Codeforces Round 533 (Div. 2)"). Round will be rated for second division (rating below 2100). As usual, participants from the first division can participate in the contest out of competition.

The round will consist of 5 problems in which you will be helping some of my friends and you will be given two hours to help them.

I would like to thank [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the Codeforces and Polygon platforms, [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") for round coordination and help with preparation. Also thanks to [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "Master vintage_Vlad_Makeev"), [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "Master Aleks5d"),[budalnik](https://codeforces.com/profile/budalnik "Grandmaster budalnik"), [Arpa](https://codeforces.com/profile/Arpa "Master Arpa"), [mohammedehab2002](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohammedehab2002 "Master mohammedehab2002") and [----------](https://codeforces.com/profile/---------- "Master ----------") for help with preparation and testing round.

As usual score distribution will be announced shortly before the contest. 

Good luck!

**UPD1:** I'll be on the [Discord](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) channel after the contest, so we will be able to discuss the problems.

**UPD2:** Score distribution : 500-1000-1500-2000-2500
