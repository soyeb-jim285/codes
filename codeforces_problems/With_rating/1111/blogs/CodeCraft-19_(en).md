# CodeCraft-19_(en)

Hello Everyone!

I would like to invite you to CodeCraft-19, which is a part of [Felicity](https://codeforces.com/https://www.facebook.com/felicity.iiith), the annual techno-cultural fest of IIIT Hyderabad. It will take place on [Sunday, February 3, 2019 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=3&month=2&year=2019&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). 

The round will be **rated for Div 2 participants (whose ratings are lower than 2100)**. As usual, participants from the first division can participate in the contest out of the competition. You will be given **5** problems, all of which are based on the theme of our fest, "Superheroes".
