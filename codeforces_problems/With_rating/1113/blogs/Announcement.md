# Announcement

Good day to you, Codeforces!

Let me introduce you [Codeforces Round #539](https://codeforces.com/contests/1109,1113), that will take place at [Saturday, February 16, 2019 at 19:35](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=2&year=2019&hour=19&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be **rated** for both divisions.

The problems of this round were developed by [markysha](https://codeforces.com/profile/markysha "Master markysha"), [xolm](https://codeforces.com/profile/xolm "Master xolm"), [aleex](https://codeforces.com/profile/aleex "Master aleex"). That is our first round on Codeforces, and I hope not the last one :)
