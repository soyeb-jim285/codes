Hello Codeforces!

We are honored to invite you to Codeforces Round #538 (Div. 2), which will take place at [Sunday, February 10, 2019 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=10&month=2&year=2019&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for all Division 2 participants **(with rating less than 2100)**. Still, we warmly welcome Division 1 participants to join us out of competition.

You will be given **6** problems to solve in **2 hours.** The round's problems were initially prepared by Duy-Bach [AkiLotus](https://codeforces.com/profile/AkiLotus "Master AkiLotus") Le, Xuan-Tung [neko_nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa](https://codeforces.com/profile/neko_nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa "Master neko_nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") Nguyen and Xuan-Quang [xuanquang1999](https://codeforces.com/profile/xuanquang1999 "Grandmaster xuanquang1999") D. Nguyen.

**There will be an interactive problem in this round.** Learn more about interactive problems [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).

This is our first attempt in making a Codeforces round, so suggestions are much welcome to help us improve ourselves. ;)

We also want to thanks many friends for making this round possible:

 * Dmitry [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") Sayutin for coordinating the round, providing a neat idea on one problem and some Russian translations.
* Andrew [GreenGrape](https://codeforces.com/profile/GreenGrape "Master GreenGrape") Rayskiy for various suggestions on the problems, some other Russian translations, **and most importantly, peacefully submitted himself to be quarantined from pretests.** ;)
* Michal [majk](https://codeforces.com/profile/majk "International Grandmaster majk") Svagerka for testing the round.
* And last but not least, Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for the amazing Codeforces and Polygon platform, without which this round would never be possible :D

P/s: I will be at the [Discord CP Community](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) to discuss the problems after the coding phase. However, please follow the rules and don't discuss the problems during the contest by any means.

*Wish everyone good luck and high rating!*

**UPD1:** Score distribution: 500-1250-1500-2000-2000-2750

**UPD2:** [Editorial is published.](Tutorial_(ru).md)

**UPD3:** The contest is finished. I apologized for the "somewhat" weak pretests at here and there. Anyway, time to celebrate our winners ;)
