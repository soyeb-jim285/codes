Attention tech specialists! 

Harbour.Space Barcelona is proud to announce a collaboration with one of our industrial partners to offer a fully funded scholarship for our one year Master’s in Data Science Programme at HSU Barcelona. 

The Scholarship includes: 

 * **Full coverage** of the Programme’s tuition fee (€23,000 value)
* 3 hours of study a day at Harbour.Space University
* 4 hours of internship a day with one of our industrial partners
* €12,000 euros a year (living allowance)

Our data science programme will feature super star teachers like Mike Mirzayanov (Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures), Alexey Dral (Big Data: Map Reduce, Spark, BigTable/HBase) and Alex Dainiak (Discrete Optimisation), plus many more. 

**Harbour.Space is unique because**: 

 1. **We don’t play by the rules**. We bring practicing professionals, not only academic teachers, who come teach for intense, 3 week modules. HSU students are encouraged to experiment, fail, and try again, until they succeed.
2. **We are your home**. Harbour.Space is a community of over 40 nationalities, and we're still growing.
3. **We provide an experience**. Harbour.Space University is located in Barcelona, one of the most vibrant cities of our time.
