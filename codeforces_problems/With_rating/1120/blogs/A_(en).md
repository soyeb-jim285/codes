For those who want to compete on the same problems, we will hold two regular Codeforces Rounds in the evening: one for the first division, and another one for the second. The rounds are starting at [Sunday, March 3, 2019 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=3&month=3&year=2019&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166)!

**If you are a participant of the official Technocup Finals, you are not allowed to take part in the rounds at evening. We ask participants of the official Finals not to discuss the problems in open media till evening.**

Good luck!

The rounds are over. We sincerely apologize for the fail with the mirror rounds, we thought the editorial was only streamed to other sites of the olympiad, not online. You can read [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov")'s [comment](A_(en).md?#comment-496450) about the situation. I hope you enjoyed solving the problems even though they did not affected your rating.

Huge thanks to those people who worked on the problems for you, namely Alexander [Golovanov399](https://codeforces.com/profile/Golovanov399 "International Grandmaster Golovanov399") Golovanov, Konstantin [zemen](https://codeforces.com/profile/zemen "International Grandmaster zemen") Semenov, Daria [Dashk0](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dashk0 "Candidate Master Dashk0") Kolodzey, Mikhail [Endagorion](https://codeforces.com/profile/Endagorion "International Grandmaster Endagorion") Tikhomirov, Ilia [irkstepanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/irkstepanov "Grandmaster irkstepanov") Stepanov and Denis [Denisson](https://codeforces.com/profile/Denisson "International Grandmaster Denisson") Shpakovskij.
