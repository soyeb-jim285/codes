Hey Codeforces!

We’re thrilled to invite you guys to Codeforces Round #542, which is going to take place on [Sunday, February 24, 2019, at 18:35 MSK](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=24&month=2&year=2019&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). There will be a separate round for each division, and they will be rated!

Problems were prepared by [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Штаб, MikeMirzayanov"), [zoomswk](https://codeforces.com/profile/zoomswk "Мастер zoomswk") and me. As the round authors, we would like to thank [ksun48](https://codeforces.com/profile/ksun48 "Легендарный гроссмейстер ksun48"), [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "Международный гроссмейстер isaf27"), [tuna_salad](https://codeforces.com/profile/tuna_salad "Гроссмейстер tuna_salad"), and [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Легендарный гроссмейстер Um_nik") for testing the problems; [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Международный гроссмейстер 300iq") and [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Гроссмейстер KAN") for their help and advice in contest preparation; and the invisible [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Штаб, MikeMirzayanov") for the incredible Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

Each division will be given 6 tasks and 2 hours to solve them. As per the Codeforces tradition, scoring distributions will be revealed shortly before the round.

We wish you the greenest verdicts and hope that you’ll enjoy the tasks.

This round is in honor of Alex Lopashev who has supported Codeforces on its anniversary. Some words from [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Штаб, MikeMirzayanov"):

 
> Alex Lopashev studied at Programming Competitions Training Center (in Saratov U) headed by me. I was really happy (and even proud!) to see his contribution on the 8th anniversary of Codeforces. I am sure that a large number of young people got a lot from our community, even if they did not achieve high results in competitions. It's great that there are those who remember and appreciate it. Thank you, Alex!

Good luck!
