Hi everyone!

I would like to invite you to my second Codeforces round, which I have created with my friends [Ashishgup](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ashishgup "Master Ashishgup") and [Vivek1998299](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vivek1998299 "Candidate Master Vivek1998299").

With that said, I bring to your attention our new [Codeforces Round 548 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1139 "Codeforces Round 548 (Div. 2)") that will take place on [Thursday, March 21, 2019 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=21&month=3&year=2019&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). If your rating is less than 2100, this round will be rated for you; otherwise, you can participate out of competition.

I would like to thank [Ashishgup](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ashishgup "Master Ashishgup") and [Vivek1998299](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vivek1998299 "Candidate Master Vivek1998299") for their help with preparing problems, [vintage_Vlad_Makeev](https://codeforces.com/profile/vintage_Vlad_Makeev "Grandmaster vintage_Vlad_Makeev"), [mohammedehab2002](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohammedehab2002 "Master mohammedehab2002") and [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik") for testing the problems and [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") for coordinating our round. I would also like to thank [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. Scoring distribution will be announced later.

Good luck! :D
