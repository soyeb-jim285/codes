# Forethought_Future_Cup_(en)

Hi Codeforces!

I'm excited to announce the Forethought Future Cup! It will consist of two rounds, an online round on [April 20th, 11:05am PDT](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=20&month=4&year=2019&hour=21&min=5&sec=0&p1=166), and an onsite round on [May 4th, 10:05am PDT](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=5&year=2019&hour=20&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). **Both of these rounds will be rated and open for all participants**. The top 25 local contestants near San Francisco will be invited to the Forethought office to take part onsite.

Each round will be a combined round. In the first round, there will be 8 problems in 2.5 hours. There will be at least one interactive problem in this round. Please read the [interactive problem guide](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) if you haven’t already.

The problems in this round were all written by me. Thanks to [ismagilov.code](https://codeforces.com/profile/ismagilov.code "International Master ismagilov.code"), [mohammedehab2002](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohammedehab2002 "Master mohammedehab2002"), [Jeel_Vaishnav](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jeel_Vaishnav "Master Jeel_Vaishnav"), [Learner99](https://codeforces.com/profile/Learner99 "Candidate Master Learner99"), [dojiboy9](https://codeforces.com/profile/dojiboy9 "Candidate Master dojiboy9"), [vlyubin](https://codeforces.com/profile/vlyubin "Candidate Master vlyubin"), [y0105w49](https://codeforces.com/profile/y0105w49 "International Grandmaster y0105w49"), [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN"), [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") for testing and coordination.
