# Announcement

Hi!

On [Saturday, June 1, 2019 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=6&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) we will host Codeforces Global Round 3.

It is the third round of a new series of Codeforces Global Rounds supported by XTX Markets. The rounds are open for everybody, the rating will be updated for everybody.

The prizes for this round:

 * 30 best participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2019:

 * In each round top-100 participants get points according to the [table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT).
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of points he gets in the four rounds he placed the highest.
* The best 20 participants over all series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

The problems of the round were developed by me, [Egor.Lifar](https://codeforces.com/profile/Egor.Lifar "International Master Egor.Lifar") and [Jatana](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jatana "Grandmaster Jatana"). We are glad to say that we have prepared 8 tricky tasks for you. We hope you will enjoy them!

**UPD. 1:**

Here are a few words from the sponsor of Global Rounds, XTX Markets.

*Hello, I’m Yuri Bedny from XTX Markets! While studying at university I actively took part in programming contests and later got to apply these skills at XTX Markets. Our office in London (UK) is looking for candidates for two open positions. We hope it will be interesting for some of you to apply your skills and knowledge in problems we are solving. I wish good luck to all the participants and hope you’ll enjoy the problems.*

*Open positions at XTX:*

 * *XTX Markets is looking to expand its Java team. You’d be expected to be able to design low-level data structures and algorithms to fit particular performance characteristics. **We have a direct impact on profits and very little bureaucracy and are open to candidates with no financial experience.** Read the details via [the link](https://codeforces.com/https://www.xtxmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/efxdev-Job-SpecFinR.pdf).*
* *XTX Markets is hiring into its Core Development team in London. This team is responsible for the design and implementation of the platform that provides a broad range of post-trade functionality essential to the firm’s business. This complex, distributed system has been developed in-house using a distributed microservices architecture to provide high throughput (thousands of trades per second) and high availability (24x7 operation) while also allowing very agile but well-controlled development practices (multiple production releases per day). **The system is implemented primarily in Go, but prior Go experience is not required for those willing and able to learn quickly. The only necessary skills are exceptional programming ability, a passion for solving real-world problems, and a dedication to rigorous software engineering.** Read the details via [the link](https://codeforces.com/https://www.xtxmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Core-Developer-Job-Specf.pdf).*

*If you are interested in these positions, then fill out the application form via [the link](https://codeforces.com/userForm/59741dd2ec6eff917d0aa2715eddd4eb) or during registration for the competition.*

**UPD. 2:**

The scoring distribution will be **500 — 1250 — 1500 — 1750 — 2250 — 3000 — 4000 — 4000**. The round will last 2 hours and 15 minutes.
