Hi Codeforces!

I'm so happy to invite you to [Codeforces Round 556 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1149 "Codeforces Round 556 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 556 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1150 "Codeforces Round 556 (Div. 2)")! The rounds will be held on [Monday, April 29, 2019 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=29&month=4&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for both divisions. (At least that's what I've been told!)

The problems were written and prepared by me. Thanks to [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq") for the round coordination, and to [Radewoosh](https://codeforces.com/profile/Radewoosh "Legendary Grandmaster Radewoosh") for his invaluable help with choosing the problemset and testing the problems! Also, I want to give a shout-out to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for his amazing Codeforces and Polygon platforms!
