My gratitude to [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") and [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for coordinating the round, [Markellonchik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Markellonchik "Master Markellonchik") (special thanks for the help in preparing one of the tasks), [mohammedehab2002](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohammedehab2002 "Master mohammedehab2002"), [Jeel_Vaishnav](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jeel_Vaishnav "Master Jeel_Vaishnav") for testing, and also [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq") for the idea and preparation of one of the tasks, [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "Master Aleks5d") and [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27") for testing it, and of course [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for Codeforces and Polygon systems.
