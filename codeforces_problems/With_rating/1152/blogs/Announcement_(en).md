*(He last walked the Earth in round [538](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65033) btw.)*

Hello Codeforces!

We are here to invite you to Codeforces Round #554 (Div. 2), which will take place at [Wednesday, April 24, 2019 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=24&month=4&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The round will be rated for all Division 2 participants **(with rating less than 2100)**, yet any Division 1 participants are welcome to join us out of competition.

The round will be cat themed. Raise your paws and prepare your catnips!

*(Or even cat memes, while you're at it).*

You will be given **6+1** problems ( **6** problems, one of them has **2** subtasks ) to solve in **2 hours.** The round's problems were prepared by Xuan-Quang [xuanquang1999](https://codeforces.com/profile/xuanquang1999 "Grandmaster xuanquang1999") D. Nguyen, Duy-Bach [AkiLotus](https://codeforces.com/profile/AkiLotus "Expert AkiLotus") Le, Stefan [stefdasca](https://codeforces.com/profile/stefdasca "Candidate Master stefdasca") Dascalescu, Quang-Minh [MofK](https://codeforces.com/profile/MofK "Grandmaster MofK") D. Nguyen and our dear Codeforces coordinator Dmitry [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") Sayutin.

*Gladly (or sadly), no interactive problem tonight!*

Also, the tribute should be given to everyone within the team â€” we all make it possible:

 * Andrew [GreenGrape](https://codeforces.com/profile/GreenGrape "Master GreenGrape") Rayskiy for various problem suggestions **and the infamous OMEGALULRIP influence.** ;)
* Xuan-Tung [neko_nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa](https://codeforces.com/profile/neko_nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa "International Master neko_nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") Nguyen for testing the rounds and various suggestions in the core theme idea. Nya~.

Last but not least, I want to give a huge appreciation to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platform, which makes this contest possible.

P/s: I will be at the [Discord CP Community](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) to discuss the problems after the coding phase. However, please follow the rules and don't discuss the problems during the contest by any means.

*Wish everyone good luck and high rating!*

P/s(2): Commies united!
