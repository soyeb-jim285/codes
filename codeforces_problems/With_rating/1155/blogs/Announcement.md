Hi Codeforces!

This summer, we want to invite you to Tech Scouts, the two-week summer camp we run from the 8th-19th of July in one of Barcelona's leading international schools, St.Paul’s.

This camp, divided into Creative and Technical tracks, is designed to lay out the foundation of knowledge for high-school students in the fields of technology, mathematics, business and design. Both tracks are taught in English.

We would love to see you guys at our camp this year — if you’re interested in joining, or if you just want to know more, just head over to the [Tech Scouts website](https://codeforces.com/https://techscouts.harbour.space/). 

This camp is for anyone passionate about tech or design, so if you know someone who might be interested, be sure to let them know too!

Ps. Don’t wait too long — you still have an early bird discount, but only until May 20th

**UPD:** The round will contain 6 problems.
