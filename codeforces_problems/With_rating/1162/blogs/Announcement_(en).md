**UPD 2** Pictures from the onsite round: <https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66876>

**UPD 3**: I'm sorry, but to prevent the leak of onsite results, we will postpone the start of system testing a bit. As soon as the closing ceremony finish at Forethought office, we will immediately start the system testing of the rounds. Until this time, the rounds will be hidden. But don't panic, this will only be temporary and we will return everything soon.

**UPD 4**: The results will be in around 90 minutes after the end of the competition.

**UPD 5**: Tutorial: <Tutorial_(en).md>
