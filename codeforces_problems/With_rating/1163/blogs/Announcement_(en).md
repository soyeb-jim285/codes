Hi Codeforces!

I'm glad to introduce you to [Codeforces Round 558 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1163 "Codeforces Round 558 (Div. 2)"), which will take place on [Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=9&month=5&year=2019&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166).

You will have **6 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them. **Two problems will have subtasks**. Round will be rated for everyone with rating below **2100**. Participants from the first division can also participate out of competition as usual.

The problems were prepared by me, [ArguteOnAir](https://codeforces.com/profile/ArguteOnAir "Expert ArguteOnAir"), [Shirone](https://codeforces.com/profile/Shirone "Specialist Shirone"), and [GreymaneSilverfang](https://codeforces.com/profile/GreymaneSilverfang "Candidate Master GreymaneSilverfang"). I would like to thank [cdkrot](https://codeforces.com/profile/cdkrot "Grandmaster cdkrot") for his immense help during the round preparation, [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq"), [mohammedehab2002](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohammedehab2002 "Master mohammedehab2002"), and [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik") for testing them, and of course [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

In the contest, you will meet *Kuro*, *Shiro*, *Katie*, and *Selena*, the four naughty but smart cats who love playing and asking questions. I hope you will find our problems interesting.

I will be in the community Discord server after the contest to discuss the problems with you. You can find the server [here](https://codeforces.com/https://discord.gg/auC58F)!

Good luck!

**UPD1**: Problem B and C will have 2 subtasks. The scoring distribution will be **500 — (750 + 500) — (1000 + 750) — 2250 — 2750 — 3250**.

**UPD2**: The contest will be delayed by 15 minutes due to technical reasons. Sorry for the inconvenience :(
