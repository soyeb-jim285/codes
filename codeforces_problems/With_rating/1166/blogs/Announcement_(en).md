Hi Codeforces!

We are happy to invite you to take part in [Codeforces Round 561 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1166 "Codeforces Round 561 (Div. 2)"). The contest will be held on [Friday, May 17, 2019 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=17&month=5&year=2019&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166).

You will be given **6 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them. The round will be rated for all contestants with rating **below 2100**. As usual, participants from the first division are welcome to join out of competition.

The problems were written and prepared by [Jefe](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jefe "Candidate Master Jefe") and me. We owe a huge thanks to [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for coordinating the round, to [Lewin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lewin "International Grandmaster Lewin") and [mohammedehab2002](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohammedehab2002 "Master mohammedehab2002") for testing, and of course, to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great Codeforces and Polygon platforms.
