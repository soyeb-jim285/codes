Hi!

I'm back with not one, not two, but three contests, although I have no promises about when to expect them....

The first of them, codeforces round #563, will take place on [Monday, June 3, 2019 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=3&month=6&year=2019&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). It's rated for the second division, but, as usual, first division participants can take part out of competition.

I'm the problemsetter of the round. I'd like to thank [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for coordinating the round (and his patience .. try coordinating ~20 problems), [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") for helping with the preparation, [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik"), [_overrated_](https://codeforces.com/profile/_overrated_ "Candidate Master _overrated_"), [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "Master Aleks5d"), [wiwitrifai](https://codeforces.com/profile/wiwitrifai "International Master wiwitrifai"), [pllk](https://codeforces.com/profile/pllk "International Master pllk"), [Bedge](https://codeforces.com/profile/Bedge "International Master Bedge"), [Ivan19981305](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ivan19981305 "Specialist Ivan19981305"), and [PrianishnikovaRina](https://codeforces.com/profile/PrianishnikovaRina "Specialist PrianishnikovaRina") for testing the round, and [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great codeforces and polygon platforms.

In this round, you'll be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them.

**UPD:** I decided to drop the 3 seconds rule. The scoring distribution is 500-1000-1500-1750-2500-2500. That means you should probably read both E and F :D

Good luck & Have fun!

**UPD:** here's the [editorial](Tutorial_(en).md).
