Hi!

On [Saturday, July 20, 2019 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=20&month=7&year=2019&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) we will host [Codeforces Global Round 4](https://codeforces.com/contest/1178 "Codeforces Global Round 4").

It is the fourth round of a new series of [Codeforces Global Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65002) supported by XTX Markets. The rounds are open for everybody, the rating will be updated for everybody.

You will be given 8 problems and 150 minutes to solve them. The scoring distribution will be **500-750-1250-1750-2000-(1500+1500)+3250+4000**.

The prizes for this round:

 * 30 best participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2019:

 * In each round top-100 participants get points according to the [table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT).
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of points he gets in the four rounds he placed the highest.
* The best 20 participants over the whole series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

The problems of this round were developed by me. I will be available on [Discord](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) to discuss the problems after the contest.
