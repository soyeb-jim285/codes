# Announcement

Hello, Codeforces!

We are glad to invite you to take part in [Codeforces Round 568 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1185 "Codeforces Round 568 (Div. 2)"), which will be held on [Wednesday, June 19, 2019 at 20:45UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=6&year=2019&hour=17&min=45&sec=0&p1=166). The round will consist of 7 problems (possibly, plus subproblems). It will be rated for Div. 2 participants.

We, [geranazavr555](https://codeforces.com/profile/geranazavr555 "Expert geranazavr555") and [cannor147](https://codeforces.com/profile/cannor147 "Specialist cannor147"), are students of ITMO University. And we have recently joined the developers team of Codeforces and Polygon. We have prepared this round for more careful acquaintance with the system. We hope that you will enjoy the competition.

Initially, we had prepared the round for Div. 3, but after testing, it became clear that this round is harder than usual such rounds. [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") suggested to make this to be rated for the second division.

Many thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the tremendous work on the creation and development of Codeforces and Polygon and coordinating our work. Also, special thanks to [Vshining](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vshining "Expert Vshining"), [awoo](https://codeforces.com/profile/awoo "Master awoo"), [nooinenoojno](https://codeforces.com/profile/nooinenoojno "Expert nooinenoojno"), [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Candidate Master vovuh"), [Lewin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lewin "International Grandmaster Lewin"), [Dave11ar](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dave11ar "Expert Dave11ar"), [T-D-K](https://codeforces.com/profile/T-D-K "Expert T-D-K") and [Azat_Yusupov](https://codeforces.com/profile/Azat_Yusupov "Candidate Master Azat_Yusupov") for testing the round.
