UPD: Our friends at Harbour.Space also have a message for you:

*Hello Codeforces!*

*We hope your summer is going well!* 

*Last Friday we finished the second edition of the Tech Scouts Summer Camp, with **70 participants**, **20 different nationalities** and many solved problems.* *We had **6 participants with a full scholarship** thanks to the collaboration between **Harbour.Space and Codeforces** and we are working on increasing this number next year.* 

*We would also like to remind you that we offer scholarships for our technical programmes, such as **Computer Science, Data Science and Cyber Security**.* 

*They are set in such a way that doesn’t require additional applications — we believe in merit and potential, and so what you put in your application to the university will be our criteria.*

*You could be just the diamond we’re looking for, but you’ll never know unless you apply!*
