Hello!

I'm glad to invite you all to Round 576 which will take place on [Tuesday, July 30, 2019 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=30&month=7&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

There will be 6 problem in both divisions.

Round is based on Team Olympiad in Computer Science Summer School. It is (yet another) summer school for schoolchildren organized by Higher School of Economics and "Strategy" Center in Lipetsk. Almost all the problems are authored and prepared by teachers and teaching assistants in CSSS: [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik"), [Burunduk1](https://codeforces.com/profile/Burunduk1 "International Grandmaster Burunduk1"), [fake123_loves_me](https://codeforces.com/profile/fake123_loves_me "Master fake123_loves_me"), [MakArtKar](https://codeforces.com/profile/MakArtKar "Candidate Master MakArtKar"), [Villen3tenmerth](https://codeforces.com/profile/Villen3tenmerth "Expert Villen3tenmerth"), [Aphanasiy](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aphanasiy "Expert Aphanasiy"), [Gadget](https://codeforces.com/profile/Gadget "Pupil Gadget"). One of the problems is authored by [Merkurev](https://codeforces.com/profile/Merkurev "International Grandmaster Merkurev") (just because we are friends :) ). One more problem for the round was added by [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN").

I would like to thank [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for CF round coordination, [I_love_Tanya_Romanova](https://codeforces.com/profile/I_love_Tanya_Romanova "International Grandmaster I_love_Tanya_Romanova"), [Merkurev](https://codeforces.com/profile/Merkurev "International Grandmaster Merkurev"), [Rox](https://codeforces.com/profile/Rox "Candidate Master Rox") and [74TrAkToR](https://codeforces.com/profile/74TrAkToR "Candidate Master 74TrAkToR") for testing, and Codeforces and Polygon team for these beautiful platforms.

Scoring will be announced.

Upd: We added one more problem to div.1 contest, now both contests have 6 problems (4 in common). The round is not combined, if it were, I would write "combined" in the title.

Scoring distribution:  
div2: 500-750-1250-1750-2500-3000
