Series of Educational Rounds continue being held as [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) initiative! You can read the details about the cooperation between [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) and Codeforces in the [blog post](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/51208).

This round will be **rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100**. It will be held on extended ICPC rules. The penalty for each incorrect submission until the submission with a full solution is 10 minutes. After the end of the contest you will have 12 hours to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.

Good luck to all participants!

**UPD:** Our friends at Harbour.Space also have a message for you:

*Hello Codeforces!* 

*Ready to get deep?* 

*Take a minute and ask yourselves — what skills are I missing, that I would love to have? What are those key qualities that would take me from being a decent developer to an extraordinary one?* *Am I where I want to be, in terms of personal progress?* 

*At **Harbour.Space**, we focus on **the key technical and social requirements of the jobs** of the future. Our three-week courses are designed for students to acquire and develop specific skills through seminars, workshops, projects, and case studies in a very short amount of time.*

***Mike Mirzayanov’s course, Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures**, is a great example of this:*
