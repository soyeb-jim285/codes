Hey, hi, hello.

[Codeforces Round 584 - Dasha Code Championship - Elimination Round (rated, open for everyone, Div. 1 + Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1209) starts on [Saturday, September 14, 2019 at 19:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=14&month=9&year=2019&hour=16&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) and lasts 2h30m. The score drain will be adjusted for longer contest duration. It's a combined rated round with around eight problems. It is open and it is rated for everybody. Yes, it's rated. There are Dasha t-shirts for top 30 competitors (not counting later-to-be onsite finalists).

As an extra, this is an elimination round for those who live in/near SPb/Novosibirsk. More info about the championship is in the other [blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/69530). Thanks to Dasha.AI for making such an event for the community!
