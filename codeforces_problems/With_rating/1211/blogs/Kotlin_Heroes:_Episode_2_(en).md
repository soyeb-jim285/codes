Hello, Codeforces!

First and foremost, we would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who entered and submitted their answers to the first Kotlin Heroes competition which was held back in May. Congratulations to the top 3 winners [Petr](https://codeforces.com/profile/Petr "Legendary Grandmaster Petr"), [ecnerwala](https://codeforces.com/profile/ecnerwala "Legendary Grandmaster ecnerwala"), and [eatmore](https://codeforces.com/profile/eatmore "International Grandmaster eatmore") on their incredible achievement, especially considering they were up against 4,500 other registrants from over 63 countries. We’d also like to give a shout out to tourist for being the only other person, outside of the top 3, to manage to solve every problem set from this round. Well done all of you! 

Ready to challenge yourself to do better? The second "Kotlin Heroes" competition will be hosted on the Codeforces platform on [the 7th of September, 2019, at 14:35 UTC (17:35 MSK, 07:35 PDT, 22:35 CST)](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=7&month=9&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The contest will last 2 hours 30 minutes and will feature a set of problems from simple ones, designed to be solvable by anyone, to hard ones, to make it interesting for seasoned competitive programmers. **Top three winners will get prizes of $512, $256, and $128 respectively, top 50 will win a Kotlin Heroes t-shirt and an exclusive Kotlin badge, competitors solving at least one problem will enter into a draw for one of 50 Kotlin Heroes t-shirts.**

The round will again be held in accordance with a set of slightly modified ICPC rules:

 * The round is unrated.
* The contest will have 6-10 problems of various levels of complexity.
* You are only allowed to use Kotlin to solve these problems.
* Participants are ranked according to the number of correctly solved problems. Ties are resolved based on the lowest total penalty time for all problems, which is computed as follows. For each solved problem, a penalty is set to the submission time of that problem (the time since the start of the contest). An extra penalty of 10 minutes is added for each failed submission on solved problems (i.e., if you never solve the problem, you will not be penalized for trying that problem). If two participants solved the same number of problems and scored the same penalty, then those of them who had previously made the last successful submission will be given an advantage in the distribution of prizes and gifts.

Registration is already open and available via [the link](https://codeforces.com/contests/1211,1212). It will be available until the end of the round.

  

 [REGISTER →](https://codeforces.com/contests/1211,1212)  If you are still new to Kotlin we have prepared a tutorial on [competitive programming in Kotlin](https://codeforces.com/https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/competitive-programming.html) and a practice round, where you can try to solve a few simple problems in Kotlin. All the solutions are open, which means that you can look at the solution even if you haven't solved the problem yet. The practice round is available by [the link](https://codeforces.com/contests/1212).

We wish you luck and hope you enjoy Kotlin.

**UPD**: Thank you for the participation. [The editorials](Tutorial_(en).md) are published.
