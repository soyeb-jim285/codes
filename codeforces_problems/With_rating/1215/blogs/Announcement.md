Hello Codeforces!

[Codeforces Round 585 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1215 "Codeforces Round 585 (Div. 2)") will be held on [Sunday, September 15, 2019 at 16:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=9&year=2019&hour=13&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for Div. 2 contestants. There will be 6 problems for 2 hours. **Please, notice that the start time is unusual.**

**The round will be rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100. The statements will be available in Russian and English.**

The round will start 2 hours after the start of the Qualification Stage, so they will finish around same time. That's why we ask the participants of the Quals to stay silent and don't share the statements of the contest with anyone. Unfortunately, we cannot add all the problems from Quals to the round, it will contain only six problems.

The problems were prepared by Alex [fcspartakm](https://codeforces.com/profile/fcspartakm "Candidate Master fcspartakm") Frolov and me.

We also would like to express our gratitude to Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for the permission to make a mirror and Codeforces and Polygon platforms, Ildar [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq") Gainullin for his help with testing the problems and preparing the round. Also big thanks to the testers: Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "International Master adedalic") Dalabaev and Roman [Roms](https://codeforces.com/profile/Roms "Master Roms") Glazov.

As usual, the scoring distribution will be announced just before the round.

Good luck!
