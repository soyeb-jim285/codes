**다시 만나서 반가워요, 코드포스!** (Nice to see you again, Codeforces!)

I'm again happy to introduce you to [Codeforces Round #589 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1228). Please look at following information for details:

 * This contest will take place on [Sunday, September 29, 2019 at 19:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=29&month=9&year=2019&hour=16&min=5&sec=0&p1=166).
* The round will be **rated for all Division 2 participants**.
* There are **6 problems** and you will have **2 hours** to solve them. Score distribution will be announced later.

The listed handles below are contributors. Thank you for all who listed!

 * **Main author**: [McDic](https://codeforces.com/profile/McDic "Candidate Master McDic") — I made and prepared all problems.
* **Coordinator**: [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") — He is my coordinator again.
* **Early phase testers**: [dorijanlendvaj](https://codeforces.com/profile/dorijanlendvaj "Grandmaster dorijanlendvaj") [tfg](https://codeforces.com/profile/tfg "Grandmaster tfg") [Lawali](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lawali "Master Lawali") — They are early phase testers. They mostly focused on test data.
* **Late phase testers**: [Kuroni](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kuroni "Grandmaster Kuroni") [imbr92](https://codeforces.com/profile/imbr92 "Expert imbr92") [Redux](https://codeforces.com/profile/Redux "Expert Redux") [Dr_Park](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dr_Park "Specialist Dr_Park") [Savior-of-Cross](https://codeforces.com/profile/Savior-of-Cross "Master Savior-of-Cross") [TOPCYBERFLOWER](https://codeforces.com/profile/TOPCYBERFLOWER "Expert TOPCYBERFLOWER") [_overrated_](https://codeforces.com/profile/_overrated_ "Master _overrated_") [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "Master antontrygubO_o") [raiden1943](https://codeforces.com/profile/raiden1943 "Expert raiden1943") — They are late phase testers. They gave problem difficulty/quality feedback by virtual participation.
* **Codeforces Team**: [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") and his team — They are working super hard to make Codeforces and Polygon great! Especially I love Polygon's framework! Thank you!

For this contest, I tried to improve following things:

 * **Reasonable difficulty**: At my last contest, less than 200 official participants managed to solve *at least one* of DEF. Especially, 1182D's problem difficulty rating is 2500 and 1182F's problem difficulty rating is 2900(no official solvers!). This is not good for Div.2 participants. In other words, my first contest was hell. So this time, I tried to make my second contest to have more reasonable difficulty than my first contest.
* **Stronger data**: There were *300+ successful hacks* and almost *2000 sysfails* at 1182B. At this time, I splitted testing phase into early phase and late phase. I'm bit worried, but I believe data will be stronger than my last contest.
* **Compact statement**: I remember many people complained about 1182C's super complex statement. I made very compact statements for this round. There is no problem with more than 10 lines of statement(except I/O section) in this contest.

I hope everyone can enjoy my second contest. Thanks in advance!

**UPDATES:**

 1. If you want to discuss problems in chat after contest ends, come [https://discordapp.com/invite/algorithms](https://codeforces.com/https://discordapp.com/invite/algorithms) and you can enjoy discussion.
2. I have deleted my last problem(G) from this contest during testing period. I really wanted to include that beautiful problem in my contest, but nobody solved that problem for a week. That problem will be appeared in another Div.1 contest.
3. Scoring distribution is **500(A)-1000(B)-1250(C)-1750(D)-2250(E)-2750(F)**.
