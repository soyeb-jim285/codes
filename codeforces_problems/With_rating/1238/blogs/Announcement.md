*Hello Codeforces,* 

*First of all, thank you for the great feedback on our survey from the last Educational Round. Over 300 people participated, and we hope to start implementing some of your suggestions really soon.* 

*We also wanted to let you know that we have extended the deadline for our* **fully-funded scholarships** *for Masters programs in Bangkok.* 

*Remember,* **they cover the entire tuition fee as well as the cost of living expenses**, *so If you or someone you know are interested in technology, entrepreneurship, or design, and believe you have what it takes, we want to hear from you!*

  [APPLY HERE→](https://in.harbour.space/bangkok-scholarships/?utm_source=codeforces&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=ed_round_71) Last, but not least, we would like to recommend an article published in our blog last week about the “[Top 5 Soft Skills Every Developer Has to Have](https://harbour.space/computer-science/articles/top-5-skills?utm_source=codeforces&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=ed_round_74)”.
