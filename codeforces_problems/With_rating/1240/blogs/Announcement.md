# Announcement

Hi all!

This weekend, on [Sunday, October 6, 2019 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=10&year=2019&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) we will hold Codeforces Round 591. It is based on problems of Technocup 2020 Elimination Round 1 that will be held at the same time.

Technocup is a major olympiad for Russian-speaking high-school students, so if you fall into this category, please register at [Technocup 2020 website](https://codeforces.com/https://technocup.mail.ru/) and take part in the Elimination Round.

Div. 1 and Div.2 editions are open and rated for everyone. Register and enjoy the contests!
