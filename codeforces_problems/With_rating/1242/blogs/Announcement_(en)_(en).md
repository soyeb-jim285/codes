Hi guys!

Glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round #599](https://codeforces.com/contests/1242) to be held this [Wednesday, November 6, 2019 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=11&year=2019&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166)!

My name is Evgeny Vihrov, this is already my 6th Codeforces contest as an author. To introduce myself, I have participated twice in the ACM ICPC Finals (2012, 2014) and currently I am co-coaching teams for the ICPC at the University of Latvia. This is my first solo round, and it took 3.5 years to make! (the last one was #347 with [Alex_2oo8](https://codeforces.com/profile/Alex_2oo8 "International Grandmaster Alex_2oo8")).

In this contest you will have to help Ujan deal with his renovation issues. Hopefully, everyone will find a problem matching their taste!

Huge thanks to [arsijo](https://codeforces.com/profile/arsijo "International Grandmaster arsijo") for coordinating the preparation of the contest and for the patience with the frequent delays. :) Thanks to [Xellos](https://codeforces.com/profile/Xellos "International Grandmaster Xellos"), [Origenes](https://codeforces.com/profile/Origenes "Master Origenes"), [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") and [_overrated_](https://codeforces.com/profile/_overrated_ "Master _overrated_") for generously testing the round. And as always, thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the ~~panem et circenses~~ Codeforces and Polygon systems!

Wish you an exciting round!

**UPD4:** The editorial will be available tomorrow, sorry for the delay. :((

**UPD5:** The reason behind [McDic](https://codeforces.com/profile/McDic "Master McDic") entering as a coauthor is that one problem was exactly identical to some problem from some Codeforces round. We found out about it only at the last day before the contest, and [McDic](https://codeforces.com/profile/McDic "Master McDic") generously allowed to use his problem.

**UPD6:** Editorial is [posted](Tutorial_(en).md).
