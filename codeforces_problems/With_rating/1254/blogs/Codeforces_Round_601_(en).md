Hello Codeforces!

I am glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round #601](https://codeforces.com/contests/1254,1255), which will take place on [Tuesday, November 19, 2019 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=11&year=2019&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for both divisions.

All problems in this round were created and prepared by a team of all-Vietnamese setters: [MofK](https://codeforces.com/profile/MofK "International Grandmaster MofK"), [I_love_tigersugar](https://codeforces.com/profile/I_love_tigersugar "Grandmaster I_love_tigersugar"), [UncleGrandpa](https://codeforces.com/profile/UncleGrandpa "Master UncleGrandpa"), [ngkan](https://codeforces.com/profile/ngkan "Master ngkan"). This is the first Vietnamese Div1 round. We tried to make both the problems and the statements interesting and hope that you will enjoy them!

There is an interactive problem in the round. You can read the guide for interactive problem [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).
