Hi!

Are you tired after a weekend of three (3) contests? Or are you ready for another one? On [Tuesday, December 17, 2019 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=17&month=12&year=2019&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) we will host [Codeforces Global Round 6](https://codeforces.com/contest/1266 "Codeforces Global Round 6")!

It is the sixth round of a new series of [Codeforces Global Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65002) supported by XTX Markets. The rounds are open for everybody, the rating will be updated for everybody.

You will be given 8 problems and 150 minutes to solve them. The scoring distribution will be **500-750-1250-1750-2000-2500-3500-4000**.

The prizes for this round:

 * 30 best participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2019 ([current results](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70626)):

 * In each round top-100 participants get points according to the [table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT).
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of points he gets in the four rounds he placed the highest.
* The best 20 participants over the whole series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

The problems of this round were developed by me. I will be available on [Discord](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) to discuss the problems after the contest. 

I would like to thank:

 * XTX for supporting this series of rounds,
* [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "International Grandmaster BledDest") and [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27") for their help in the round's coordination,
