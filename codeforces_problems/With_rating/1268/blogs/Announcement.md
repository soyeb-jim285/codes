Hello, Codeforces community!

I'm glad to invite you to Codeforces Round #609 (Div. 1) and Codeforces Round #609 (Div. 2), which will be held on [Saturday, December 21, 2019 at 17:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=21&month=12&year=2019&hour=14&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for both divisions.

The problems were taken (mostly) from the ByteDance — Moscow Workshops Online Contest, that's happening at the same time. They were prepared by myself and tested by [jqdai0815](https://codeforces.com/profile/jqdai0815 "Legendary Grandmaster jqdai0815"), [Claris](https://codeforces.com/profile/Claris "Grandmaster Claris"), [quailty](https://codeforces.com/profile/quailty "Grandmaster quailty"), [jiry_2](https://codeforces.com/profile/jiry_2 "International Grandmaster jiry_2") (camp TA team), and [gamegame](https://codeforces.com/profile/gamegame "International Grandmaster gamegame"), [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27"), [tmwilliamlin168](https://codeforces.com/profile/tmwilliamlin168 "International Grandmaster tmwilliamlin168"), [mango_lassi](https://codeforces.com/profile/mango_lassi "International Grandmaster mango_lassi"), [WNG](https://codeforces.com/profile/WNG "Master WNG"), [Lewin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lewin "International Grandmaster Lewin"), [sas4eka](https://codeforces.com/profile/sas4eka "Master sas4eka"), [UselessDev](https://codeforces.com/profile/UselessDev "Expert UselessDev"), [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "Master Aleks5d"),[MrDindows](https://codeforces.com/profile/MrDindows "Grandmaster MrDindows").
