Hello Codeforces!

[Codeforces Round 608 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1271 "Codeforces Round 608 (Div. 2)") will be held on [Sunday, December 15, 2019 at 15:15UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=12&year=2019&hour=12&min=15&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for Div. 2 contestants. There will be 6 problems for 2 hours. **Please, notice that the start time is unusual.**

**The round will be rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100. The statements will be available in Russian and English.**

The round coincides with (and is based on) a local Saratov's olympiad for high school students. That's why we ask the participants of the olympiad to stay silent and don't share the statements of the contest with anyone. Unfortunately, we cannot add all the problems to the round, it will contain only six problems.

The problems were proposed and prepared by Alexander [fcspartakm](https://codeforces.com/profile/fcspartakm "Candidate Master fcspartakm") Frolov, Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "International Master adedalic") Dalabaev, Vladimir [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Master vovuh") Petrov and me.
