Hello, Codeforces community!

I'm glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 607 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1280 "Codeforces Round 607 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 607 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1281 "Codeforces Round 607 (Div. 2)"), which will be held on [Sunday, December 15, 2019 at 11:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=12&year=2019&hour=8&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for both divisions.

The problems were taken (mostly) from the 2019 ICPC Asia-Manila Regional Contest that's happening at the same time. Thus, they have been prepared by various setters and testers from the Philippines: myself ([kevinsogo](https://codeforces.com/profile/kevinsogo "Grandmaster kevinsogo")), Kyle See ([kylesky](https://codeforces.com/profile/kylesky "Expert kylesky")), Payton Yao ([jabbawookiees](https://codeforces.com/profile/jabbawookiees "Expert jabbawookiees")), Tim Dumol ([timd](https://codeforces.com/profile/timd "Expert timd")), Guissmo Asuncion (guissmo in HackerRank) and Marte Soliza (myrtactle in TopCoder).

Since the problems are based on the ICPC Manila regionals, we request all the coaches onsite to refrain from making the problem set public. We also request the coaches and everyone else who has seen the problems (or part of it) to refrain from joining this round.

A huge thanks to [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27") for coordinating and helping me set up this round. Thanks to [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq") for some testing. Of course, thanks as well to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for providing us Codeforces and Polygon. These are great gifts to the competitive programming community! Also, thanks for the opportunity to use our problem set for a CF round. 

You will be given 6 problems in both divisions and 2 hours to solve them. I recommend reading all the problems; they were written by talented writers from the judging team.

Good luck, have fun, and I wish everyone high ratings!

The scoring distribution will be announced closer to the beginning of the round.

**Update:** The scoring will be as follows:

Div.2: 500 — 1250 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500 — 3000  
Div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 1750 — 2250 — 3000 

Good luck and have fun!
