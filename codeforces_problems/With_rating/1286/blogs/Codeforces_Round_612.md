# Codeforces_Round_612

Hello everybody!

Now the winter SIS (Summer Informatics School) is taking place, and we, as part of the parallel A*+ with its teachers, have prepared a complete [Codeforces Round](https://codeforces.com/contests/1286,1287).

The round will happen at [Sunday, January 5, 2020 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=5&month=1&year=2020&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) and will last for 2 hours. There will be 6 problems in each division.

The tasks of the round were invented and prepared by [ismagilov.code](https://codeforces.com/profile/ismagilov.code "Grandmaster ismagilov.code"), [devid](https://codeforces.com/profile/devid "Master devid"), [Volkov_Ivan](https://codeforces.com/profile/Volkov_Ivan "Specialist Volkov_Ivan"), [Jatana](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jatana "Master Jatana"), [karasek](https://codeforces.com/profile/karasek "Master karasek"), [polinarria](https://codeforces.com/profile/polinarria "Candidate Master polinarria"), [cookiedoth](https://codeforces.com/profile/cookiedoth "International Grandmaster cookiedoth"), [AlesyaIvanova](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlesyaIvanova "Grandmaster AlesyaIvanova"), [KhB](https://codeforces.com/profile/KhB "Expert KhB"), [AliceG](https://codeforces.com/profile/AliceG "Master AliceG"), [D.Pavlenko](https://codeforces.com/profile/D.Pavlenko "Specialist D.Pavlenko"), [VFeafanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/VFeafanov "Candidate Master VFeafanov"), [LordVoIdebug](https://codeforces.com/profile/LordVoIdebug "Candidate Master LordVoIdebug"), [forestryks](https://codeforces.com/profile/forestryks "Master forestryks"), [Ilistratov](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ilistratov "Expert Ilistratov"), [seiko.iwasawa](https://codeforces.com/profile/seiko.iwasawa "Master seiko.iwasawa"), [senjougaharin](https://codeforces.com/profile/senjougaharin "Master senjougaharin"), [Drozd_off](https://codeforces.com/profile/Drozd_off "Candidate Master Drozd_off") under the guidance of teachers [PavelKunyavskiy](https://codeforces.com/profile/PavelKunyavskiy "Specialist PavelKunyavskiy"), [VArtem](https://codeforces.com/profile/VArtem "International Grandmaster VArtem"), [meshanya](https://codeforces.com/profile/meshanya "Grandmaster meshanya"), [budalnik](https://codeforces.com/profile/budalnik "Specialist budalnik").

And, of course, thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov) for great systems Codeforces and Polygon, and [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq) for round coordination.

Good luck everybody!

UPD:

In problem E an error was made in the intended solution, an overflow of long type while calculating the answer. The first test, on which it happened, reached 4 participants ([ainta](https://codeforces.com/profile/ainta "Legendary Grandmaster ainta") [aid](https://codeforces.com/profile/aid "Legendary Grandmaster aid") [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik") [ecnerwala](https://codeforces.com/profile/ecnerwala "Legendary Grandmaster ecnerwala")), among who two passed the pretests, and two others did not, though they should have. In automatic mode, it is not possible to test so that both answers are accepted, because the overflow changes the tests because of the way the requests are encrypted. So, we decided to test two pretest solutions on the old set of tests and the rest on the new one. As a result, three of the solutions passed the tests (congratulations!), and one received WA80 on the 17th answer inside the test, which is clearly not related to the overflow problems. Only the solution that takes into account the overflow problem can be used in upsolving.
