* Thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the wonderful Codeforces and Polygon systems that made this contest possible.

The statements were made as clear as possible for your best experiences. Moreover, we sneakily included a theme in the problemset, and each problem will have an easter egg that is the clue to the theme. If you have AC'd every problem, be sure to search for the theme（*´▽｀*)

Additionally, most of us are in a Discord server dedicated to competitive programming called "AC" (this is also the motto of this contest). We will be on the server after the contest to discuss the problems with you. You can find the server [here](https://codeforces.com/https://discord.gg/qubG5Kp)!

I wish you all have good luck and high ratings ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
