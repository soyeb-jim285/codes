Hello Codeforces!

We are here to invite you to Codeforces Round #614 (Div. 1) and Codeforces Round #614 (Div. 2), which will take place at [Sunday, January 19, 2020 at 19:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=1&year=2020&hour=16&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round is rated for both divisions.

This is our first round including Div.1 parts, hopefully you'll find the problems interesting. ;)

This round is themed based on the Rayark Inc.'s rhythm game, [*"Cytus II"*](https://codeforces.com/https://www.rayark.com/g/cytus2/). You are about to help our characters in various problems, whether inside or outside of the virtual Internet! Also, feel free to listen to the music tracks I've chosen from the game for each problem (and later, editorial!). ;)

Each division will be given **6** problems to solve in **2 hours.** The round's problems were prepared by Xuan-Quang [xuanquang1999](https://codeforces.com/profile/xuanquang1999 "Grandmaster xuanquang1999") D. Nguyen, Duy-Bach [AkiLotus](https://codeforces.com/profile/AkiLotus "Master AkiLotus") Le and Tuan-Dung [low_](https://codeforces.com/profile/low_ "Master low_") To.

Interactive problem(s) might be found in this round. Learn about them [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).

We also want to thanks our friends for helping this contest being possible:
