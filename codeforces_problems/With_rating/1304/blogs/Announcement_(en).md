**안녕하세요, 코드포스!** (Hello, Codeforces!)

I'm glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 620 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1304 "Codeforces Round 620 (Div. 2)"). The contest will start at [Saturday, February 15, 2020 at 19:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=2&year=2020&hour=16&min=5&sec=0&p1=166), and it is **rated** for all participants with ratings under 2100.

You will be given **6 problems** and one of the problems has 2 subtasks. The contest duration is **2 hours**. The score distribution will be announced later.

All problems are prepared by me, with huge help from the testers with developing great solutions.

I'll be on the [community Discord server](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52778) after the contest to share my thoughts and get feedback about the problems.
