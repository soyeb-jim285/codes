Moo! (Hello Codeforces!)

I’m very excited to invite you to [Codeforces Round 621 (Div. 1 + Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1307), which will take place on [Monday, February 17, 2020 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=17&month=2&year=2020&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

In this round, you will be helping Farmer John and his prized cow Bessie cowmplete some fun tasks.

The contest will have **7 problems** and is **combined and rated for both divisions**. The duration is **2 hours and 15 minutes**. The problems are prepared by me ([FieryPhoenix](https://codeforces.com/profile/FieryPhoenix "Master FieryPhoenix")) and [dragonslayerintraining](https://codeforces.com/profile/dragonslayerintraining "Grandmaster dragonslayerintraining"). We tried very hard to make them interesting and hope that you will enjoy them too!
