# Announcement

Hello everybody!

Today, on March 1st, 2020 the final round of Technocup olympiad for Russian-speaking high school students is held. The round starts at 13:00 Moscow time.

For those who want to compete on the same problems, we will host two Codeforces rounds: one for the first, and one for the second division. The rounds will start at 13:05 UTC, don't miss them! The round will start just after the onsite contest ends, so it can be postponed slightly if the onsite event timetable changes.

If you compete in the Final Round today, you can't compete in the Codeforces round #625.

The problems are prepared by [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov"), [Endagorion](https://codeforces.com/profile/Endagorion "Legendary Grandmaster Endagorion"), [tourist](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist "Legendary Grandmaster tourist"), [Roms](https://codeforces.com/profile/Roms "Master Roms"), [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Master vovuh"), [voidmax](https://codeforces.com/profile/voidmax "International Grandmaster voidmax"), [adamant](https://codeforces.com/profile/adamant "Grandmaster adamant") and me.
