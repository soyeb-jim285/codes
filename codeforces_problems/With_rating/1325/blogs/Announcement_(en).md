Hi!

Codeforces round #628 (vintage Codeforces round #2) will take place on [Saturday, March 14, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=14&month=3&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). It's rated for the second division, but, as usual, first division participants can take part out of competition.

The problems were created by me. I'd like to thank, and orz, [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") for coordinating the round; [ramchandra](https://codeforces.com/profile/ramchandra "Expert ramchandra"), [pajenegod](https://codeforces.com/profile/pajenegod "International Master pajenegod"), [aryanc403](https://codeforces.com/profile/aryanc403 "International Master aryanc403"), [taran_1407](https://codeforces.com/profile/taran_1407 "Master taran_1407"), [Kuroni](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kuroni "International Grandmaster Kuroni"), [mcdx9524](https://codeforces.com/profile/mcdx9524 "Candidate Master mcdx9524"), [dorijanlendvaj](https://codeforces.com/profile/dorijanlendvaj "Master dorijanlendvaj"), [Andreasyan](https://codeforces.com/profile/Andreasyan "Master Andreasyan"), [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq"), [zoooma13](https://codeforces.com/profile/zoooma13 "Candidate Master zoooma13"), [Osama_Alkhodairy](https://codeforces.com/profile/Osama_Alkhodairy "Master Osama_Alkhodairy"), [Mohammad_Yasser](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mohammad_Yasser "Master Mohammad_Yasser"), and [TripleM5da](https://codeforces.com/profile/TripleM5da "Grandmaster TripleM5da") (special shout-out) for testing the round; and of course [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great codeforces and polygon platforms.

You'll be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them.
