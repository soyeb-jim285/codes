Hello, everyone! [Codeforces Round #631](https://codeforces.com/contests/1329,1330) will be held at [Friday, April 3, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=3&month=4&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The problems are almost from me([dreamoon_love_AA](https://codeforces.com/profile/dreamoon_love_AA "International Grandmaster dreamoon_love_AA")), except one problem of which the idea is from [drazil](https://codeforces.com/profile/drazil "Master drazil") and developed by me. Also we want to thank [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq") for helping me prepare the round, [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27"), [tmt514](https://codeforces.com/profile/tmt514 "International Master tmt514"), [rowdark](https://codeforces.com/profile/rowdark "International Grandmaster rowdark"), [yp155136](https://codeforces.com/profile/yp155136 "International Master yp155136"), [wangyenjen](https://codeforces.com/profile/wangyenjen "Candidate Master wangyenjen"), [n_dao107](https://codeforces.com/profile/n_dao107 "Master n_dao107") and [woruo27](https://codeforces.com/profile/woruo27 "Expert woruo27") for testing this round, and MikeMirzayanov for Codeforces and Polygon.
