*Hey Codeforces,*

*What a crazy month it’s been!* 

*We hope you and your loved ones are taking care of one another and catching up on everything you didn’t have time for on your normal schedules.* 

*We’ve temporarily closed our physical campus and moved our classes online. It’s not as bad as it sounds though — we’ve always known the future is digital, so we were already preparing for this moment. Either way, we’re back.* 

***SPECIAL PRIZE FOR EDU ROUND 85***

*This digital transformation opens the door to some pretty awesome new opportunities that allow us to get closer to our community, no matter where in the world they are.*

*That’s why we have a special prize for the next Educational Round, a space in a course of your choice from our Computer Science or Data Science Programs. You’ll be able to study online with us for 1, 2 or 3 weeks under some of the best Data and Computer Scientists in the world, with all fees on us.* 

***The prize will be for the top 3 users who have confirmed their desire to participate in this competition. To sign up for it, leave us your handle in the form below.***

*Enrollment in the course you will participate in will depend upon the availability of the course, as well as the prerequisites required for that course.*

*We hope this provides you with extra incentive for the round, and we’re looking forward to seeing some of you soon!*

*On a different note, we’re happy to announce that we’re offering full scholarships for the most talented high school students who want to study in our **Computer Science or Data Science Bachelor’s programs** at our university.*
