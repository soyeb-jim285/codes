Hi! Have you ever heard of the game called *Mahjong Soul*? It is a Japanese Mahjong game that is famous for the adorable characters.

We are excited to invite you to take part in [Codeforces Round #635](https://codeforces.com/contests/1336,1337), where you can help the characters in trouble.

Most importantly, it is **rated** for both divisions!

Each division will be given **6 problems** and you will have **2.5 hours** to solve them. An interactive problem may be found in this round. If you are not familiar with interactive problems, you can learn about them [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).
