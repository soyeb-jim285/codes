* **CF Admins**: Thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") and his team for maintaining Codeforces and Polygon. I would like to say same sentence again as I said in my last round's announcement. Polygon is super great platform to prepare sports programming contest.

Followings are some fun things:

 * [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") is the most intense coordinator I have ever met. He rejected lots of my problems. Some example of rejection comments are below:
	+ *This problem is too standard.*
	+ *Don't ask people about theorem and formula.*
	+ *This problem is appeared in recent ptz camp with higher constraints.*
	+ *I don't like it.*
	+ *Rock Scissor Paper makes statement messy, because some people don't know about it.*
	+ *D2A should be easier than this one.*
	+ *I've found generalized version of this problem in POI.*
	+ *Isn't this obvious?*
	+ *Your proof is wrong.*
	+ *This problem is not very interesting.*
	+ *This is too **(censored)**.*
* After lots of rejections, I tried my best to make problems to be interesting. I hope you like at least some of my problems.
* This round was originally supposed to be rated for Div.2 only. However, after we completed Phase 1 testing, we found that my round is too hard for Div.2, so we added more problems and made this round to be Div.1.
* In this round, statements will be even shorter than last contest.
* Even for some of problems which my coordinator approved, there were critical issues that made problems to be excluded. I will introduce some of my rejected problems which won't be used anymore in another post, after this contest ends.

I hope everyone can enjoy my third contest. Thanks in advance!

 1. Score Distribution:
	* **Div.1: 500 1000 1500 2000 2750**
	* **Div.2: 500 750 1250 1750 2250**
2. I am sorry for such Div2C/Div1A statement issue. We fixed that immediately after few minutes to the round, but we should have announced it.
3. Editorial is posted: <Editorial_(en).md>
4. I opened [new mashup](https://codeforces.com/contestInvitation/82783fbe3d4bfa08b345ac428d328c83b772dc4c) for excluded problems. These problems are originally approved by [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") but excluded for some reasons.
	1. **Binomial Determinant** is old Div1D. We found this problem on google so we removed this.
	2. **Divisible Xor** is old Div1A. But since we made 3 xor problems, we removed this one.
