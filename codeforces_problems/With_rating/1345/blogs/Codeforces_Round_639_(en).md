Hello, Codeforces!

I'm very glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 639 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1344 "Codeforces Round 639 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 639 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1345 "Codeforces Round 639 (Div. 2)"). This contest will take place on [Wednesday, May 6, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=5&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). In both divisions, you will have **2 hours 15 minutes** to solve **6 problems**. The score distribution will be announced closer to the start of the contest.

Of course, this round would not be possible without the help of many people, who I'd like to thank:

 * [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27"), for coordinating this round, and helping with solution ideas.
* My ICPC teammates [Kuroni](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kuroni "International Grandmaster Kuroni") and [strongoier](https://codeforces.com/profile/strongoier "Candidate Master strongoier"), and coach [cnh355](https://codeforces.com/profile/cnh355 "Expert cnh355"), for encouraging me to pursue competitive programming. In particular, I'd like to thank [Kuroni](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kuroni "International Grandmaster Kuroni") for being so spectacularly bad that a barely-orange user like myself actually has a place on our team.
* [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq"), [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Master antontrygubO_o"), [Ari](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ari "Master Ari"), [ffao](https://codeforces.com/profile/ffao "International Grandmaster ffao"), [fpc_coder](https://codeforces.com/profile/fpc_coder "Specialist fpc_coder"), [gamegame](https://codeforces.com/profile/gamegame "International Grandmaster gamegame"), [Kuroni](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kuroni "International Grandmaster Kuroni"), [entropy07](https://codeforces.com/profile/entropy07 "Expert entropy07"), [McDic](https://codeforces.com/profile/McDic "Candidate Master McDic"), [richzli](https://codeforces.com/profile/richzli "Expert richzli"), and [VilgefortzOfRoggeveen](https://codeforces.com/profile/VilgefortzOfRoggeveen "Pupil VilgefortzOfRoggeveen") for testing and providing valuable feedback.
* [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "International Grandmaster KAN") for checking the problem statements, making them even clearer.
* [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for providing the Codeforces and Monogon Polygon platforms.

I've done my best to write clear problem statements and strong pretests. Don't forget to read all problems, and I hope you enjoy the round. Good luck!

Because I know you all have so many questions, I have compiled an FAQ:

 * Q: Is it rated?
* A: Yes.

**UPD**

Here is the score distribution.

Div. 1: **500 — 1000 — 1500 — 1750 — 2500 — 2500**

Div. 2: **500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500 — 2750**

**UPD** Unfortunately, this contest is [delayed](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/76844) due to problems in the Codeforces system. It is temporarily scheduled, but I will update this announcement when a final decision on scheduling has been made. It is sad that my contest is delayed, but let's be grateful that the issue was detected early instead of arising in the middle of the round. On the bright side, this may be the earliest announced score distribution in Codeforces history.

**UPD** The final decision on scheduling is to keep it as is. The contest will take place on [Wednesday, May 6, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=5&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

**UPD** Unfortunately due to the long queue and other issues, the contest is unrated. There was also a bug that gave us trouble in answering your questions. I'm sorry if you asked a question that went unanswered for a long time. I promise we did our best to answer as many questions as we could! Despite all the problems, I hope you enjoyed the problemset!
