Hello, Codeforces!

Paul [stingray](https://codeforces.com/profile/stingray "Unrated, stingray") Komkoff is my hero! He found some issues in the network configuration. The most important of them was about flow control auto-negotiation: in case of our network routers the number of dropped packets reduced in times. Thanks!

To be sure that it really helped to fix the issue I ask you to take part in [Testing Round 16 (Unrated)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1351 "Testing Round 16 (Unrated)"). It will start on [Thursday, May 7, 2020 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=7&month=5&year=2020&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). Probably, it will contain 3 easy problems which are not prepared for now (I'll use some old problems, I think). The only reason to host the round is to check the system under a load. It will be an unrated round.

I am upset about what happened with the last round. Once again, I apologize to both the participants and the writer, coordinator and testers. I wrote [Monogon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Monogon "Master Monogon") about the incident and apologized.

I am sure that the only way to **absolutely** prevent unrated rounds is just don't host them. And this is not my way. The most popular rounds were hosted without noticeable technical problems. And I'm sure the main records are yet to come. I ask the writers and coordinators to look forward with optimism and try to please us with problems.

Please, join to the testing round. See you!

â€” Mike.

**UPD:** Thank you for testing! I think the system worked great. It seems recent reconfiguration improved system performance and stability. We have some rare "Judgement failed" after database update (I'll try to fix them asap).
