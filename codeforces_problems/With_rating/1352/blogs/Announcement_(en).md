*I almost copied my previous blog post to separate two discussions: about Div. 4 in general and about Round 640. Please, visit [this blog post](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77028) to discuss Div. 4 rounds.*

Hello Codeforces!

Yes, it is not a mistake I decided to run the first Div. 4 round: [Codeforces Round 640 (Div. 4)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1352 "Codeforces Round 640 (Div. 4)")! It starts on [Saturday, May 9, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=9&month=5&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:

 * 5-8 tasks;
* ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission;
* 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points)
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests and the ratings recalculated
* by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are unrated participant/newcomer).

I urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism, but simply to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest to the official participants.

Only *trusted participants of the fourth division* will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating with unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participants of the fourth division*, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1600 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a *trusted participant of the fourth division* or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you.**

Please, read some of my thoughts about the problems of this round:

 * Don't expect A+B level problems :-) It is a real contest with easy but problems. I hope most problems fit in range D3A-D3D problems.
* I'm not sure about order of problems. Try to read all problems or at least most of them. Testers expressed skepticism about the order of the problems but suggested different pairs of problems to swap.

We are just starting, so the complexity of the problems may deviate somewhere from your or my expectations. Wait and see.

The first "thank you" is sent to [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Master antontrygubO_o"), who helped with the review and selection of problems.

I hope you enjoy the problems, and the round will be interesting!
