Hello, Codeforces!

I'm glad to invite you to Round 643 which will start at [Saturday, May 16, 2020 at 17:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=5&year=2020&hour=14&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). **Please notice the unusual time.**

There will be 6 problems in round, one of them will be interactive. If you are not familiar with interactive problems, you can learn about them [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).
