*With this round, we want to say thank you to Algo Muse for the significant contribution and support!*

*Algo Muse is an educational site that conducts online algorithmic contests in pen-and-paper style (no coding). It was originally started to help students prepare for theory qualifiers for graduate admissions. At present, the problems have a broader appeal, though occasionally an odd problem may require knowledge of linear algebra, probability, or group theory. The website is maintained by former students of IIT Bombay.
