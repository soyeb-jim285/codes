# Announcement_(en)

Hi everyone!

Codeforces round #649 will take place on [Saturday, June 13, 2020 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=13&month=6&year=2020&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). It's rated for the second division, but, as usual, first division participants can take part out of competition.

The problems were created by me. I'd like to thank my forever orzable coordinator [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "Grandmaster antontrygubO_o"); my incredible army of testers [dorijanlendvaj](https://codeforces.com/profile/dorijanlendvaj "Grandmaster dorijanlendvaj"), [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "Legendary Grandmaster 300iq"), [Osama_Alkhodairy](https://codeforces.com/profile/Osama_Alkhodairy "Master Osama_Alkhodairy"), [AmShZ](https://codeforces.com/profile/AmShZ "Master AmShZ"), [taran_1407](https://codeforces.com/profile/taran_1407 "Master taran_1407"), [TigranMec](https://codeforces.com/profile/TigranMec "Master TigranMec"), [_Aaryan_](https://codeforces.com/profile/_Aaryan_ "Master _Aaryan_"), [Mohammad_Yasser](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mohammad_Yasser "Master Mohammad_Yasser"), [zoooma13](https://codeforces.com/profile/zoooma13 "Candidate Master zoooma13"), [lavish315](https://codeforces.com/profile/lavish315 "Master lavish315"), [Utkarsh.25dec](https://codeforces.com/profile/Utkarsh.25dec "Master Utkarsh.25dec"), [far_from_NOOB](https://codeforces.com/profile/far_from_NOOB "Master far_from_NOOB"), and [Laggy](https://codeforces.com/profile/Laggy "Specialist Laggy"); and, of course, you-know-who for the amazing codeforces and polygon platforms.

This time, in an effort to kill type-races and because I'm lazy, you'll be given 5 problems and 2 hours to solve them.

**UPD:** the scoring distribution will be 750-1000-1500-2000-2500.

**UPD:** the [editorial](Tutorial_(en).md) is out.
