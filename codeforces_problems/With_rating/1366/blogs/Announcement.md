*Hey Codeforces!* 

*A couple of weeks ago, we had the pleasure of hosting a webinar featuring Sergey Gordeichik, CIO of the Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Director of the University’s Cybersecurity Programme.* 

*In his talk, Sergey shared his expertise and insights on how AI is being used both positively and negatively during the COVID-19 global pandemic. He touched on topics such as the ethics of using this technology, and how it was implemented during each phase of the pandemic.* 

*We know not everyone had the chance to tune in during the webinar, so we thought you’d be interested in having a look at the slide deck of his presentation.* 

*You can [check it out here](https://codeforces.com/https://drive.google.com/file/d/18jfX7l7VETUShTzC7PhvRuzr9DzsemuZ/view).* 

*If this was interesting for you, let us know in the comments, and we’ll do our best to try and provide more content like this. Keep an eye out for the final two talks in [our webinar series](https://codeforces.com/https://webinars.harbour.space/) — they might be of interest to you* :) 

*Finally, don’t forget that this July, Sergey is teaching a course on the Cybersecurity of Cloud, Big Data, and AI. The course will be 100% online, so be sure to check it out on our website if you’re interested. [Here’s the link](https://codeforces.com/https://in.harbour.space/cyber-security/cybersecurity-of-cloud-big-data-and-ai-sergey-gordeychik/).*

*That’s all from us!* 

*Good luck in the round, and we’ll see you soon!*
