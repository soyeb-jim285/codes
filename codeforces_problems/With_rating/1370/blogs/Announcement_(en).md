Hi everyone!

I would like to invite you to another one of our rounds, that I set with my friends [FastestFinger](https://codeforces.com/profile/FastestFinger "Master FastestFinger"), [smartnj](https://codeforces.com/profile/smartnj "Candidate Master smartnj"), [the_hyp0cr1t3](https://codeforces.com/profile/the_hyp0cr1t3 "Expert the_hyp0cr1t3") and [ridbit10](https://codeforces.com/profile/ridbit10 "Expert ridbit10"). 

The round [Codeforces Round 651 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1370 "Codeforces Round 651 (Div. 2)") will take place on [Saturday, June 20, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=20&month=6&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). If your rating is less than **2100**, this round will be rated for you; otherwise, you can participate out of competition.

I would really like to thank my co-setters and:

Based on past reviews, we have:

 * Tried to make A easier and make the difficulty gradient a bit better
* Reduced the number of AdHoc problems and made the problemset more diverse

You will be given **6 problems** and **2 hours 15 minutes** to solve them.

Good luck! :D

The scoring distribution will be: 500−1000−1500−2000−2500−(2000+1250)500−1000−1500−2000−2500−(2000+1250)

**Upd:** [Quick editorial](Tutorial_(en).md) — Hope you guys found the problems interesting :D
