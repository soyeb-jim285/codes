Codeforcesの皆さん、こんにちは!(Hello, Codeforces!)

I'm glad to invite you to my first contest, [Codeforces Round 654 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1371 "Codeforces Round 654 (Div. 2)") which will be held on [Wednesday, July 1, 2020 at 19:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=7&year=2020&hour=16&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) (notice **earlier time** than usual). All of the problems were mainly written and prepared by me. The round is **rated if your rating is strictly less than 2100**.

You will be given **6 problems** (one problem has a subtask) and **2 hours** to solve them. Please, read all the problems.
