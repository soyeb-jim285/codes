Hi!

On [Saturday, July 4, 2020 at 20:45UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=7&year=2020&hour=17&min=45&sec=0&p1=166) we will host [Codeforces Global Round 9](https://codeforces.com/contest/1375 "Codeforces Global Round 9").

It is the third round of a 2020 series of [Codeforces Global Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65002). The rounds are open and rated for everybody.

The prizes for this round:

 * 30 best participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2020:

 * In each round top-100 participants get points according to the table.
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of points he gets in the four rounds he placed the highest.
* The best 20 participants over all series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

Thanks to XTX, which in 2020 supported the global rounds initiative!
