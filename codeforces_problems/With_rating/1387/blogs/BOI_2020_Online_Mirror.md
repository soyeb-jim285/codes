The Baltic Olympiad in Informatics 2020 (BOI 2020) is an individual contest for secondary school students from eleven countries (in alphabetic order): Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Ukraine. Over 60 secondary school students compete against each other, solving difficult problems of algorithmic nature. Each country sends their top 6 contestants from their national olympiads which take place in the months beforehand. You can check out the official web page at [boi2020.lv](https://codeforces.com/http://www.boi2020.lv/).

The contest consists of two days; each day the students are given 5 hours to solve 3 problems of various difficulty. Each problem is worth 100 points that are distributed into multiple subtasks with different constraints that allow the participant to earn partial score. For the testing, the IOI grading format is used, where the participant receives full feedback of the execution of the solution on all tests during the contest.

This year the contest was supposed to be held in Latvia, Ventspils, but is not held onsite due to the pandemic, and the students will compete in a proctored setting online. With generous help from [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov"), we are glad to also provide the mirror contest at Codeforces for anyone interested.

Note that the contest **is not rated**. The mirror starts with a delay of 1 day, 1 hour and 5 minutes.

We wish you to enjoy the contest! :)
