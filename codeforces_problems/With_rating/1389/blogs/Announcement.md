Our friends at Harbour.Space also have a message for you:

![Codeforces and Harbour.Space](images/7c0b3221ff57b58302ef0b6294de927f5562762d.png)

*Hey Codeforces!* 

*We hope you’ve been doing well these past couples of weeks.*

*This week, we wanted to share a blog post about two of our students. As you might know, Harbour.Space has a unique approach to education — besides classwork and exams, we encourage our students to develop their skills with hands-on projects or even create their startups, so that they’re ready for the workforce when they graduate.* 

*That’s exactly what Jonathan and Khaled, two of our Data Science students, did.*

*After working hard on their Machine Learning-based startup, they were selected by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) for a 5 Week Student Entrepreneurship Programme, and are now preparing to travel to Geneva in October. We summarized the story of how they went from data scientists to startup founders in this article.* 

*We hope it inspires you to pursue your passions, and work collaboratively to improve the world for those around you.* 

*Good luck on your round, and see you next time!*
