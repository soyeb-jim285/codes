Hi! ![](images/2ee2f0f95f05aae6ca6f47812dae2dc2aabf277b.png)

On [Sunday, August 16, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=8&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) we will host [Codeforces Global Round 10](https://codeforces.com/contest/1392 "Codeforces Global Round 10").

This is the fourth round of a 2020 series of [Codeforces Global Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65002). The rounds are open and rated for everybody.

The prizes for this round are as follows:

 * The top 30 participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2020 are as follows:

 * In each round, the top 100 participants get points according to [this table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT).
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of the points they got in the four rounds where they placed the highest.
* The top 30 participants over all series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

Thanks to XTX for supporting the global rounds initiative in 2020!

We had **a lot** of testers as the problemset of the round changed significantly throughout testing! As a result of the huge amount of feedback, we think that we've managed to make the round really high quality and hope that you'll enjoy it :)

You will be given **3 hours** to solve **9 problems**. The score distribution will be announced at some point in time before the contest starts. Good luck!

**UPD:** Score distribution:

**500 — 750 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500 — 3000 — 3500 — 4000**

**UPD:** [Editorial](Tutorial_(en).md)

**UPD:** System tests have finished. We hope you liked the problems! We apologize for the weak pretests on A and B — that was a major oversight on our part. Hopefully you were still able to enjoy the contest regardless :)

Congratulations to the winners!
