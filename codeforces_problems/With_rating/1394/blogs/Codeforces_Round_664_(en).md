There will be **5 problems** in Div.1 round and **6 problems** in Div.2 round. You'll be given **2 hours** to solve them.

The story of this round is about that man. Instead of displaying his name, I prefer telling one of his legends (or joke):

"I have a 'friend', who makes lots of money every day, earning a billion in the blink of eyes. With a wave of his hand, OIers all over the world will follow him."

You can post your guesses in the comments.

**UPD**: Score Distribution:

 * Div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 1750 — 2500
* Div.2: 500 — 750 — 1000 — 1250 — 1750 — 2250

Good luck!
