Hello Codeforces!

[gyh20](https://codeforces.com/profile/gyh20 "Мастер gyh20") and I are glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 670 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1406 "Codeforces Round 670 (Div. 2)") which will start on [Saturday, September 12, 2020 at 19:45UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=12&month=9&year=2020&hour=16&min=45&sec=0&p1=166). **Note the unusual start time of the round.**

The contest will last for **two hours**, and you will have **five tasks** to solve. The tasks are prepared by me and [gyh20](https://codeforces.com/profile/gyh20 "Мастер gyh20"). This round is rated for participants whose **rating is not higher than 2099**. You can see that my current rating is exactly **2099** :)

There might be an interactive problem. You can learn about them [here](https://codeforces.ml/blog/entry/45307).
