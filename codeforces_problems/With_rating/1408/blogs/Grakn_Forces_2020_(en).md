**About Grakn Labs**

[Grakn Labs](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/graknlabs) is a team of people driven by a purpose: to solve the world's most complex problems, through [knowledge engineering](https://codeforces.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering). We are the inventors of the [Grakn](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn) knowledge graph and the [Graql](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/graknlabs/graql) query language. Our technology helps organizations in various industries, including Life Sciences, Defence & Security, Financial Services, and Robotics, to build intelligent systems that will change the world. From financial analytics to drug discovery, cyber threat detection to robotics disaster recovery, our technology empowers engineers around the world to tackle a higher order of [complexity in knowledge](https://codeforces.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network) and solve the world's most complex problems.

Based in London, UK, and founded in 2016, Grakn Labs is a team of people driven by a purpose: to solve the world's most complex problems, through [knowledge engineering](https://codeforces.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering). In 2017, we were awarded [Product of the Year](https://codeforces.com/https://blog.grakn.ai/cambridge-computer-lab-ring-product-of-the-year-2017-goes-to-grakn-ai-d0d7c5ba9f55) by the University of Cambridge. After only a few years, our pioneering community has grown to 6K+ engineers, spread across 10+ countries around the globe -- and we're still growing. To continue pursuing this vision, we need to build a team of individuals who are not just the best and brightest in what they do, but also driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for the world.

**What is Grakn and Graql?** 

[Grakn](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn) is a distributed knowledge graph: a logical database to organize large and complex networks of data as one body of knowledge. Grakn provides knowledge engineering tools for developers to easily leverage the power of [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning](https://codeforces.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) when building complex systems. Ultimately, Grakn serves as the knowledge-base foundation for cognitive and intelligent systems.

[Graql](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/graknlabs/graql) is Grakn's query language. It provides an expressive knowledge schema language through an enhanced entity-relationship model, transactional queries that perform deductive reasoning in real-time, and analytical queries with native distributed Pregel and MapReduce algorithms. Graql provides a strong abstraction over low-level data constructs and complex relationships.

Graql is distributed as an [open-source technology](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/graknlabs), while Grakn comes in two forms: Grakn Core — which is also open-source, and Grakn KGMS — our enterprise Knowledge Graph Management Service, available through Google Cloud and Amazon AWS.
