You will be given **6 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them (or to play Valorant, because the contest is related to it for some reason). **One problem has an easy version and a hard version**.

You will have to help the agents from the game to grind that rating. Try your best as if you are playing ranked and they are your teammates!
