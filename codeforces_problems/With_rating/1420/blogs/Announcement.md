# Announcement

Hello, Codeforces!

I am very glad to invite you to the [Codeforces Round #672 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1420), which will take place in [Thursday, September 24, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=24&month=9&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). **This round will be rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100**.

All tasks were made by me, but [gepardo](https://codeforces.com/profile/gepardo "Grandmaster gepardo") helped me a lot with the last two tasks, probably these tasks wouldn't have appeared if he didn't help me.

My thanks to:

 * [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") for coordinating this round. With this great coordination only good tasks remained in the contest.
* [gepardo](https://codeforces.com/profile/gepardo "Grandmaster gepardo") made a lot, there wouldn't have been this contest if he didn't help me. He not only helped me with making last two tasks, but also helped me to understand how to make tasks for Codeforces rounds. Thanks!
