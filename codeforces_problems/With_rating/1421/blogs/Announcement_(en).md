Hi Codeforces!

[stefdasca](https://codeforces.com/profile/stefdasca "Master stefdasca"), [koala_bear00](https://codeforces.com/profile/koala_bear00 "Expert koala_bear00") and I are very excited to announce our first contest [Codeforces Round #676](https://codeforces.com/contest/1421), which will take place [Sunday, October 18, 2020 at 15:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=10&year=2020&hour=12&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for participants with rating up to 2099.

The tasks were written by me with help from [stefdasca](https://codeforces.com/profile/stefdasca "Master stefdasca") and [koala_bear00](https://codeforces.com/profile/koala_bear00 "Expert koala_bear00") and you have to help some of the authors' favorite musical artists to solve the problems they're faced with.

We hope we compiled a very interesting contest with memorable tasks :)
