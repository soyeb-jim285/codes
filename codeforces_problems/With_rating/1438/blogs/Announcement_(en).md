Good Evening Codeforces! ^_^

This round is unrated; please read [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/84595) to know why.

I invite you to participate in [Codeforces Round #682 (Div.2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1438) taking place on [Friday, November 13, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=13&month=11&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round, authored by [Anti-Light](https://codeforces.com/profile/Anti-Light "Expert Anti-Light") and me, is rated for users rated less than 2100, while other users can participate non-competitively. 

The round features six problems, and you have 2 hours to solve them. There may, or may not, be an interactive problem; regardless, you should [know](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) how to deal with them.
