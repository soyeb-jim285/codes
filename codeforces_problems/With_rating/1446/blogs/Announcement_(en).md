Hello, Codeforces!

On behalf of Meet IT, I'm glad to invite you to ([Codeforces Round #683 by Meet IT (Div1, Div2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1446,1447) which will take place [this Sunday (15th November)](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=11&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). 

The round lasts 2.5 hours and is **rated** for both divisions. 

### What is Meet IT?

We are a family of enthusiastic and motivated young people passionate about programming and mathematics. We build a community where people learn together, motivate and help each other.

* We all work on the same goal: a better education for everyone,

* We are curious, ask questions, and explore,
* 1 hour practising is worth more than 10 hours watching someone else
