# Announcement_(en)

Hi everyone!

I would like to invite you to another one of our rounds, that I set with my friends [Jeel_Vaishnav](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jeel_Vaishnav "Grandmaster Jeel_Vaishnav"), [FastestFinger](https://codeforces.com/profile/FastestFinger "Master FastestFinger"), [Utkarsh.25dec](https://codeforces.com/profile/Utkarsh.25dec "Master Utkarsh.25dec"), [the_hyp0cr1t3](https://codeforces.com/profile/the_hyp0cr1t3 "Candidate Master the_hyp0cr1t3") and [ridbit10](https://codeforces.com/profile/ridbit10 "Expert ridbit10")

We had two approved contests, but decided to merge it into one with more logical thinking ^_^ 

The round [Codeforces Round 685 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1451 "Codeforces Round 685 (Div. 2)") that will take place on [Saturday, November 21, 2020 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=21&month=11&year=2020&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). If your rating is less than **2100**, this round will be rated for you; otherwise, you can participate out of competition.

I would really like to thank my co-setters and:
