**오랜만이에요, 코드포스!** (Long time no see, Codeforces!)

I'd like to welcome all of you to [Codeforces Round 688 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1453 "Codeforces Round 688 (Div. 2)")! The contest will start at [Friday, December 4, 2020 at 19:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=12&year=2020&hour=16&min=5&sec=0&p1=166), and it is **rated** for all participants with ratings under 2100. **Note the semi-unusual start time**.

You will be given **6 problems** and **2 hours and 15 minutes** to solve them. The score distribution will be announced soon.

All problems are prepared by me, with a lot of help from the testers ~~making me realize that my solutions are dumb~~.
