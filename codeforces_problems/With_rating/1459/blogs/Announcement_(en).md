Hello, Codeforces community!

I'm glad to invite you to Codeforces Round #691 (Div. 1) and Codeforces Round #691 (Div. 2), which will be held on [Saturday, December 19, 2020 at 15:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=12&year=2020&hour=12&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). **The round will be rated for both divisions.**

The problems were taken (mostly) from the ByteDance — Moscow Workshops Online Contest, which is happening at the same time. They were prepared by me, [AndreySergunin](https://codeforces.com/profile/AndreySergunin "Международный гроссмейстер AndreySergunin"), and [amethyst0](https://codeforces.com/profile/amethyst0 "Международный гроссмейстер amethyst0").
