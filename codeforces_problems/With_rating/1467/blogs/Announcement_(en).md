Hello Codeforces!

I am pleased to invite you to my first contest [Codeforces Round 695 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1467 "Codeforces Round 695 (Div. 2)"), which will take place on [Friday, January 8, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=8&month=1&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The problems were written by [alimq](https://codeforces.com/profile/alimq "Candidate Master alimq") and [DS007](https://codeforces.com/profile/DS007 "Master DS007"). The round is rated for all users with rating less than 2100, while other users can participate unofficially.

You will be given 5 problems and 2 hours to solve them. You are strongly advised to read all the problems.
