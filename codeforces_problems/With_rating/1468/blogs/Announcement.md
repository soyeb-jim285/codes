I invite ICPC teams and individual participants of Codeforces competitions to take part!

Of course, the competition will be unrated. I ask the participants of the official competition to refrain from participating in the mirror and discussing problems until its end.

Since this year the audience of participants was wider (due to the online format), we also selected problems a little more accessible than in previous years. If you are from the top team that claims a medal in the ICPC Finals, then it may be more fun for you to take part in this contest personally.

Good luck!
