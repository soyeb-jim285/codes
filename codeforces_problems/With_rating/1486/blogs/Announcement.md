# Announcement

Hi, Codeforces!

I finally get to return something to this great community, so I am glad to invite you to take part in [Codeforces Round #703 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1486), which will take place on [Thursday, February 18, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=2&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be **rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100**. Participants from the first division are also welcomed to take part out of competition.

You will be given **2 hours 15 minutes** to solve **6 problems**. All the problems were created and prepared by me. One of the problems is interactive, please read [the guide of interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) before the contest.

Scoring: 500−1000−(750+750)−1750−2250−3000.

Don't forget to read ALL the problems. I wish you good luck and high ratings!

I tried my best to create some good problems and clear statements, so I hope you'll enjoy the round:) 

 **Story**My first message from message from [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") was more than a year ago! Also [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") has rejected almost 30 (29 to be exact) problems to this point, so you can see I really tried my best to deliver this round. It was a great journey, I hope to come back with a Div. 1 or even a Global round in the future!
