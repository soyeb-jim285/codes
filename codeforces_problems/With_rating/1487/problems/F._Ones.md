You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer $n$.

You have to represent $n$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits '1'). For example, $24 = 11 + 11 + 1 + 1$ and $102 = 111 - 11 + 1 + 1$. 

Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.

#### Input

The single line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n < 10^{50}$).

#### Output

Print one integer $x$ â€” the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of $n$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses $x$ ones in total.
