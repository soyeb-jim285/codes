*The future is bulletproof  
 The aftermath is secondary  
 It's time to do it now and do it loud!*

Hello, Codeforces!

[74TrAkToR](https://codeforces.com/profile/74TrAkToR "Master 74TrAkToR") and I are glad to invite you to our [Codeforces Round 705 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1493 "Codeforces Round 705 (Div. 2)"), which will be held at [Saturday, March 6, 2021 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=3&year=2021&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). Notice the unusual time of the round. **The round will be rated for all the participants with rating strictly less than 2100.**

We have already held a round and we have worked on errors:

 * the statements will be short and clear
* we tried to make pretests stronger
* the editorial will be published shortly after the round ends

We would like to thank everyone who helped us a lot with round preparation.
