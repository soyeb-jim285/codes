*Dear Codeforces!* 

*We are coming with another scholarship opportunity to share with you. This time, our scholarship is targeted towards the brightest women in the community.* 

*As you might know, March is the month where the whole world celebrates women. At Harbour.Space we want to use this opportunity to encourage more women to join the tech world and challenge the gender-bias in this field.* 

*We believe that gender equality in the workplace starts with gender equality in the classroom. For that reason, we are offering our **Women in Tech Scholarship**. The scholarship consists of:*

 * *50% off the yearly tuition fee: covers around €29,000 for bachelors and €11,450 for masters.*
* *32% off the application fee: €85 instead of €125*
