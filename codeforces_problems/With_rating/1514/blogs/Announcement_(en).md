Hi everyone!

Codeforces round #716 will take place on [Monday, April 19, 2021 at 19:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=4&year=2021&hour=16&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). It's rated for the second division, but, as usual, first division participants can take part out of competition.

The problems are based on the Egyptian IOI qualification, and they were created by me and [mahmoudbadawy](https://codeforces.com/profile/mahmoudbadawy "Master mahmoudbadawy"). I'd like to thank:

 * [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Legendary Grandmaster KAN") and [budalnik](https://codeforces.com/profile/budalnik "International Grandmaster budalnik") for their excellent coordination.
* [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") for improving a problem, then rejecting all our problems without reading them, then testing the round.
* [Yousef_Salama](https://codeforces.com/profile/Yousef_Salama "Grandmaster Yousef_Salama"), [Mohammad_Yasser](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mohammad_Yasser "Master Mohammad_Yasser"), [Noureldin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Noureldin "Master Noureldin"), and [ahmad_salah](https://codeforces.com/profile/ahmad_salah "Expert ahmad_salah") for testing the official contest.
* [74TrAkToR](https://codeforces.com/profile/74TrAkToR "Grandmaster 74TrAkToR") and [psevdoinsaf](https://codeforces.com/profile/psevdoinsaf "Candidate Master psevdoinsaf") for testing the round.
* [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great codeforces and polygon platforms.

This may be the most and only balanced round I've ever set. You'll be given 5 problems and 2:15 hours to solve them.

**UPD:** the scoring distribution will be 500-1000-1500-2000-2500.

**UPD:** the [editorial](Tutorial_(en).md) is out.
