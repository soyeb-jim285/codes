It's me again!

Codeforces round #717 will take place on [Wednesday, April 21, 2021 at 19:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=21&month=4&year=2021&hour=16&min=35&sec=0&p1=166), an hour early than the usual timing. It's rated for the second division, but, as usual, first division participants can take part out of competition.

The problems were created by me, and some of them are based on the Egyptian IOI qualification. I'd like to thank:

 * [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Legendary Grandmaster KAN") and [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "Grandmaster Aleks5d") for their excellent coordination.
* [Akulyat](https://codeforces.com/profile/Akulyat "International Master Akulyat"), [__cucumber__](https://codeforces.com/profile/__cucumber__ "Master __cucumber__"), [Randle](https://codeforces.com/profile/Randle "Candidate Master Randle"), [Riladavin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Riladavin "Candidate Master Riladavin"), [Waley](https://codeforces.com/profile/Waley "Candidate Master Waley"), [MForest](https://codeforces.com/profile/MForest "Master MForest"), [Stefan2417](https://codeforces.com/profile/Stefan2417 "Expert Stefan2417"), [RabbitPower](https://codeforces.com/profile/RabbitPower "Expert RabbitPower"), and the official contestants, I guess, for testing the round.
* [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

You'll be given 5 problems, but this time you'll have 2 hours to solve them.

**UPD:** the scoring distribution will be 500-1000-1500-2000-2750.
