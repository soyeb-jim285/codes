We have the following introductory message by the 2050 volunteers:

2050 aims to equip young people to take action and to become volunteers. Every 'last weekend' of Apr, together with the youth, we celebrate the technology at Yunqi Town, China. 2050 is a volunteer-only, not-for-profit unconference.

"Most of the conferences in China are held for those who are already successful in their careers, but none targets young people. 2050 wants to fill the gap, giving Chinese youth a stage to make their own voices heard and maximize their energy and talent," said Dr. Wang Jian.

### What to expect at 2050?

At 2050, we call it containers. There are 10 containers: 2050 Youth; Migratory Bird Program; Game On; Mindnet; Youth Stage; Starry Night Camping; Everything Grows; Explorer Space; New Gen Forum; Youth Reunion.

### Special arrangement of this year

This year, because of the pandemic and travel restriction, many friends from overseas cannot join us in Hangzhou. This however, cannot stop us from connecting with each other. 2050 will be connecting with 100 cities, to dial in volunteers who cannot join us onsite.

### The road to championship @ new gen forum

Algorithms and programming are their pleasures of life. With the belief of victory, they defeated the most powerful opponents. They worked hard to explore the boundaries of human intelligence on the road to the ultimate. We invite the top competitive programming players around the world to share their journeys on Saturday at 23:00~24:00 (UTC+8). If you are interested, please message [littlelittlehorse](https://codeforces.com/profile/littlelittlehorse "Grandmaster littlelittlehorse").
