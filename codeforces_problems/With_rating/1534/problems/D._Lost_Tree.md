This is an interactive problem.

Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of $n$ nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

The game master only allows him to ask one type of question:

* Little Dormi picks a node $r$ ($1 \le r \le n$), and the game master will reply with an array $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$, where $d_i$ is the length of the shortest path from node $r$ to $i$, for all $1 \le i \le n$.

Additionally, to make the game unfair challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ questions, where $\lceil x \rceil$ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.

Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy!

## Note

 that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.

#### Input

The first line of input contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2\,000$), the number of nodes in the tree.

You will then begin interaction.

#### Output

When your program has found the tree, first output a line consisting of a single "!" followed by $n-1$ lines each with two space separated integers $a$ and $b$, denoting an edge connecting nodes $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le n$). Once you are done, terminate your program normally immediately after flushing the output stream.

You may output the edges in any order and an edge $(a,b)$ is considered the same as an edge $(b,a)$. Answering is not considered as a query.

## Interaction

After taking input, you may make at most $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ queries. Each query is made in the format "? r", where $r$ is an integer $1 \le r \le n$ that denotes the node you want to pick for that query.

You will then receive $n$ space separated integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$, where $d_i$ is the length of the shortest path from node $r$ to $i$, followed by a newline.

After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

* fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
* System.out.flush() in Java;
* flush(output) in Pascal;
* stdout.flush() in Python;
* see documentation for other languages.

If at any point you make an invalid query or try to make more than $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ queries, the interaction will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

Hacks

To hack a solution, use the following format.

The first line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2\,000$).

The next $nâˆ’1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$) denoting an edge between $u$ and $v$ ($u \neq v$). These $n-1$ edges must form a tree.

## Examples

#### Input


```text
4

0 1 2 2

1 0 1 1
```
#### Output

```text

? 1

? 2

!
4 2
1 2
2 3

```
#### Input


```text
5

2 2 1 1 0
```
#### Output


```text
? 5

!
4 5
3 5
2 4
1 3
```
## Note

Here is the tree from the first example.

Additionally, here are the answers for querying every single node in example $1$:

* $1$: $[0,1,2,2]$
* $2$: $[1,0,1,1]$
* $3$: $[2,1,0,2]$
* $4$: $[2,1,2,0]$

Below is the tree from the second example interaction.

* $1$: $[0,4,1,3,2]$
* $2$: $[4,0,3,1,2]$
* $3$: $[1,3,0,2,1]$
* $4$: $[3,1,2,0,1]$
* $5$: $[2,2,1,1,0]$
