Hello Codeforces!

We, the disciples of Omkar ([qlf9](https://codeforces.com/profile/qlf9 "Candidate Master qlf9"), [Tlatoani](https://codeforces.com/profile/Tlatoani "International Grandmaster Tlatoani"), [MagentaCobra](https://codeforces.com/profile/MagentaCobra "Master MagentaCobra"), [golions](https://codeforces.com/profile/golions "Master golions"), and Omkar's newest disciple, [rabaiBomkarBittalBang](https://codeforces.com/profile/rabaiBomkarBittalBang "Candidate Master rabaiBomkarBittalBang")), have written our third contest: [Codeforces Round 724 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1536 "Codeforces Round 724 (Div. 2)") — [Omkar 3](https://codeforces.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI-pw4DdHEw). It will be held on [Sunday, June 6, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=6&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) and will be rated for users in Division 2 (rating lower than 2100). As usual participants with rating >= 2100 are allowed to compete too, but the contest will be unrated for them.

You will be given **2 hours** to solve **6 problems**. There may or may not be an interactive problem, so it would behoove you to read the [guide for interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307). There also may or may not be competitive programming problems, so you should be sure to thoroughly understand everything [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/91363).

We would like to thank:
