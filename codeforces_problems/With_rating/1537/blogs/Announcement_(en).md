#### Hello Codeforces!

[mesanu](https://codeforces.com/profile/mesanu "Expert mesanu") and I are very glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 726 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1537 "Codeforces Round 726 (Div. 2)") which will take place on [Friday, June 18, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=6&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be **rated for participants with a rating lower than 2100**. Division 1 participants are also welcomed to take part in the competition but it will be unrated for them. 

The round was originally planned to be a division 3 round so the problems might be slightly easier than average Div 2.

You will be given **6 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them.
