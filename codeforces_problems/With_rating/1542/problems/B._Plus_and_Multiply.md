There is an infinite set generated as follows:

* $1$ is in this set.
* If $x$ is in this set, $x \cdot a$ and $x+b$ both are in this set.

For example, when $a=3$ and $b=6$, the five smallest elements of the set are:

* $1$,
* $3$ ($1$ is in this set, so $1\cdot a=3$ is in this set),
* $7$ ($1$ is in this set, so $1+b=7$ is in this set),
* $9$ ($3$ is in this set, so $3\cdot a=9$ is in this set),
* $13$ ($7$ is in this set, so $7+b=13$ is in this set).

Given positive integers $a$, $b$, $n$, determine if $n$ is in this set.

### Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1\leq t\leq 10^5$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line describing each test case contains three integers $n$, $a$, $b$ ($1\leq n,a,b\leq 10^9$) separated by a single space.

### Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if $n$ is in this set, and "No" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.

## Example

### Input


```text
5
24 3 5
10 3 6
2345 1 4
19260817 394 485
19260817 233 264
```
### Output


```text
Yes
No
Yes
No
Yes
```
## Note

In the first test case, $24$ is generated as follows:

* $1$ is in this set, so $3$ and $6$ are in this set;
* $3$ is in this set, so $9$ and $8$ are in this set;
* $8$ is in this set, so $24$ and $13$ are in this set.

Thus we can see $24$ is in this set.

The five smallest elements of the set in the second test case is described in statements. We can see that $10$ isn't among them.
