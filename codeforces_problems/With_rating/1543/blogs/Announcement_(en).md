Hello Codeforces!

I am quite excited to invite you to my first ever round, [Codeforces Round 730 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1543 "Codeforces Round 730 (Div. 2)") which will start on [Wednesday, July 7, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=7&month=7&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). **The round will be rated for participants of Division 2 (having rating strictly less than 2100).** As always, Division 1 participants are welcome to participate in the round but it will be unrated for them.

The problems of this round will be themed on the 2005 video game ***Need For Speed: Most Wanted***. You will be given **5 problems** and **2 hours 15 minutes** to solve them. One of the problems will be **interactive**. So, it is recommended to read the [guide on interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) before the round.

I would like to thank -
