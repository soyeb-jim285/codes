Hello, Codeforces!

I'm glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 732 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1545 "Codeforces Round 732 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 732 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1546 "Codeforces Round 732 (Div. 2)"), which will be held on [Sunday, July 11, 2021 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=11&month=7&year=2021&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). **Note the unusual start time of the round.**

The round will be rated for both divisions. Each division will have **6 problems** and **2.5 hours** to solve them. There may or may not be an interactive problem, so I suggest you should read the [guide for interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).

This is my first round ever. Great efforts have been put in during the past six months. We are sincerely looking forward to your participation. We hope everyone will enjoy it.

Good luck!

**UPD1**: Here's the score distribution:

Div 1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2250 — (2000+2000) — 4000

Div 2: 500 — 1000 — 1250 — 1750 — 2250 — 3000

**UPD2**: Sorry to everyone! This is my first round and I spent lots of time to prepare it. I prepared at least 23 problems, and chose these eight ones for this round. I invited 35 testers to test, and chose problems according to their feedback. However, the difficulty is more than expect.And the pretest is not strong, leading to FST for many people. I blamed myself sadly. So I must say sorry to you, my dear friends. I will improve myself in the future. Wish you good luck and happy everyday. (๑•ᴗ•๑)

**UPD4**: **Congratulations to the winners**
