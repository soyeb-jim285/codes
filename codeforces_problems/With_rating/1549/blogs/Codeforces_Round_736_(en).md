Hello, Westeros!

I'm glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 736 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1548 "Codeforces Round 736 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 736 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1549 "Codeforces Round 736 (Div. 2)"), which will be held on [Sunday, August 1, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=8&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The round will be rated for both divisions. Each division will have 5-7 problems and 2 hours and 15 minutes to solve them. There **will not** be an interactive problem, so yay!!!

 1. [Aleks5d](https://codeforces.com/profile/Aleks5d "International Master Aleks5d"), for awesome coordination of my round.
2. [Benq](https://codeforces.com/profile/Benq "Legendary Grandmaster Benq"), for extensive testing and contributions throughout the round, especially for [1548E - Gregor and the Two Painters](https://codeforces.com/contest/1548/problem/E "Codeforces Round 736 (Div. 1)").
