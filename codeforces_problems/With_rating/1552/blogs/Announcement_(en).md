Hi!

On [Sunday, July 25, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=25&month=7&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) we will host [Codeforces Global Round 15](https://codeforces.com/contest/1552 "Codeforces Global Round 15").

This is the third round of the 2021 series of [Codeforces Global Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65002). The rounds are open and rated for everybody.

The prizes for this round are as follows:

 * 30 best participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2021:

 * In each round top-100 participants get points according to the [table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT).
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of points he gets in the four rounds he placed the highest.
* The best 20 participants over all series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

Thanks to XTX, which in 2021 supported the global rounds initiative!

Problems for this round are set by [cip999](https://codeforces.com/profile/cip999 "Master cip999") and me. Thanks a lot to the coordinator [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Grandmaster antontrygubO_o"), to the testers [gamegame](https://codeforces.com/profile/gamegame "Legendary Grandmaster gamegame"), [ajit](https://codeforces.com/profile/ajit "Candidate Master ajit"), [golions](https://codeforces.com/profile/golions "Candidate Master golions"), [skydogli](https://codeforces.com/profile/skydogli "Grandmaster skydogli"), [McDic](https://codeforces.com/profile/McDic "Candidate Master McDic"), [rabaiBomkarBittalBang](https://codeforces.com/profile/rabaiBomkarBittalBang "Master rabaiBomkarBittalBang"), [nweeks](https://codeforces.com/profile/nweeks "International Master nweeks"), [Marckess](https://codeforces.com/profile/Marckess "International Grandmaster Marckess"), [HenriqueBrito](https://codeforces.com/profile/HenriqueBrito "Expert HenriqueBrito"), [gratus907](https://codeforces.com/profile/gratus907 "Candidate Master gratus907"), [bWayne](https://codeforces.com/profile/bWayne "Expert bWayne"), [zscoder](https://codeforces.com/profile/zscoder "International Grandmaster zscoder"), [TheOneYouWant](https://codeforces.com/profile/TheOneYouWant "Grandmaster TheOneYouWant"), and to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

You will be given **9 problems** and **2 hours 45 minutes** to solve them. 

The scoring distribution is 250-500-1000-1000-1500-1500-2500-2750-3750.

 **If you are tempted to make one more comment on the scoring distribution, read this.**This scoring distribution is not particularly strange, unusual or deep. There is no demoralization tactic, no baiting tactic, no need to give a gazillion points to the last problem. It is simply the scoring distribution that we consider more adequate for the problemset. 250 is not particularly low for a first problem, 3750 is not particularly high for a last one. Everything is normal.

Please, do not waste your time thinking about the scoring distribution... watch the Olympic Games instead!

Good luck and see you in the standings!

**UPDATE 1**: Thank you very much for participating, we hope you liked the problems (and sorry to top contestants for giving a not-so-fresh problem I).

Here you can find the [editorial](Tutorial_(en).md) (with a bit of behind-the-scenes, some obscenely wrong preditions, and hints for all the problems).

**UPDATE 2**: Congratulations to the winners!
