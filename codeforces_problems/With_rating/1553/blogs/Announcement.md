  [Sign up for the contest →](https://codeforces.com/contests/1553) For the next academic year (2021/22), we are recruiting a fascinating community of competitive programmers from the top prize-winners of international Olympiads to [join one of our competitive programming teams at the university](https://harbour.space/computer-science/articles/competitive-programming-scholarships?utm_source=codeforces&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=programming_team&utm_content=HSSCcontest). 

In the next few years, our goal is to win SWERC and compete at a high level in the ICPC globally. Therefore we want to invest a serious amount of our energy, resources, and talent into these activities. 

That’s why we are inviting you on an exciting journey in the company of like-minded people, outstanding coaches, and our ongoing partnership with Codeforces.

We have already organized over 100 educational rounds, so we think the time has come to test our joint efforts and reward the most diligent.
