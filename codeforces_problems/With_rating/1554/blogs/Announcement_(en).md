I would like to thank -

The statements are super short and I have tried to make the pretests strong. I encourage you to read all the problems and solve them all.

I would like to dedicate this contest to the fallen king, my father, who died two months ago. May he and all the departed good souls rest in peace.

Scoring distribution: 750−1250−1750−2000−3000750−1250−1750−2000−3000.
