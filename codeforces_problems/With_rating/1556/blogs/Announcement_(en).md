 Hi Codeforces!

We are **[DELTIX](https://codeforces.com/https://deltix.io/)**. Founded in 2005, DELTIX is one of the market leaders in software development for financial research and products for systematic and algorithmic trading. In 2020 DELTIX joined the EPAM family. Our mission is to turn promising ideas into breakthrough products fast. 

We are experts in:

 * aggregation, storage, and processing large volumes of time-series data
* data modeling
* testing and deployment of quantitative models

In our team we value such skills as: 

 * knowledge of algorithms
* high-performance coding
* low latency data streams processing

We are excited to announce that one of our products [TimeBase Community Edition](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/finos/TimeBase-CE) joined a [FinTech Open-Source Foundation (FINOS)](https://codeforces.com/https://www.finos.org/) on the 14th of July. 

[TimeBase](https://codeforces.com/https://timebase.info/) is a multi-faceted, open-source data-streaming powerhouse, combining a time-series database, message broker, data modeling, and a well-optimized serialization framework. Originally, TimeBase was designed to address use cases in the financial domain. Nevertheless, we take on new challenges in other areas such as IoT, cloud computing, clustering, high-performance computing, parallel data processing, and Big Data to name a few.
