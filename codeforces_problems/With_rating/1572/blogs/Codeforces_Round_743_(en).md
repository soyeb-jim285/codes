Hello Codeforces!

[Asymmetry](https://codeforces.com/profile/Asymmetry "Master Asymmetry") and I are glad to invite you to [Codeforces Round 743 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1572 "Codeforces Round 743 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 743 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1573 "Codeforces Round 743 (Div. 2)"), which will be held on [Saturday, September 18, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=9&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).
