The duration will be **5 hours**, consisting of **13 problems**. You can register individually, but teams are preferred. You may expect relatively easier problems than ICPC Regional Contests. You may code parallely with several computers with your teammates and use prewritten codes and templates.

COMPFEST itself is an annual event hosted by Universitas Indonesia. It is the largest student-run IT event in Indonesia and competitive programming contest is one of the competitions hosted.

We've put great effort into preparing this contest and we hope that you will enjoy it. See you! **„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ**~! üêæ
