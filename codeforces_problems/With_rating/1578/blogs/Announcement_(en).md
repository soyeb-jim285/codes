Hello, everybody!

We would like to invite you to participate in the Mirror of The ICPC World Finals Moscow Invitational Contest. The original contest was made for the teams who cannot come to The World Finals in Moscow. They were competing for the medals and glory. The Invitational contest has already passed and the results will be revealed on October 5th.

The mirror contest will be held by almost standard ICPC rules with 10 to 14 problems. The difference from the traditional ICPC format is that your team can use three computers instead of one. The problems are expected to be of The World Finals difficulty. **Also, the round will be unrated!**

The problemset was prepared by NERC Jury Team with the help of many other people. The chief judge is Roman [elizarov](https://codeforces.com/profile/elizarov "Candidate Master elizarov") Elizarov. The jury members are Pavel [PavelKunyavskiy](https://codeforces.com/profile/PavelKunyavskiy "International Grandmaster PavelKunyavskiy") Kunyavskiy, Georgy [kgeorgiy](https://codeforces.com/profile/kgeorgiy "Unrated, kgeorgiy") Korneev, Evgeny [eatmore](https://codeforces.com/profile/eatmore "International Grandmaster eatmore") Kapun, Ilya [izban](https://codeforces.com/profile/izban "International Grandmaster izban") Zban, Niyaz [niyaznigmatul](https://codeforces.com/profile/niyaznigmatul "International Grandmaster niyaznigmatul") Nigmatullin, Vasiliy [SirShokoladina](https://codeforces.com/profile/SirShokoladina "International Grandmaster SirShokoladina") Mokin, Daniil [danilka.pro](https://codeforces.com/profile/danilka.pro "Grandmaster danilka.pro") Sagunov, Gennady [tourist](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist "Legendary Grandmaster tourist") Korotkevich, Oleg [snarknews](https://codeforces.com/profile/snarknews "Unrated, snarknews") Hristenko, Egor [Egor](https://codeforces.com/profile/Egor "Legendary Grandmaster Egor") Kulikov, Borys [qwerty787788](https://codeforces.com/profile/qwerty787788 "International Grandmaster qwerty787788") Minaev, Pavel [pashka](https://codeforces.com/profile/pashka "International Grandmaster pashka") Mavrin, Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov, Anton Paramonov, Bruce [bmerry](https://codeforces.com/profile/bmerry "Legendary Grandmaster bmerry") Merry, Zachary [Friggstad](https://codeforces.com/profile/Friggstad "Expert Friggstad") Friggstad, Jakub Wojtaszczyk, David Van Brackle, and myself.
