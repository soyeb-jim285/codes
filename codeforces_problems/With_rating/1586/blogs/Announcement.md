# Announcement

Hi all!

This weekend, at [Sunday, October 17, 2021 at 17:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=17&month=10&year=2021&hour=14&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) we will hold [Codeforces Round 749 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, based on Technocup 2022 Elimination Round 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1586). It is based on the problems of Technocup 2022 Elimination Round 1 that will be held at the same time.
