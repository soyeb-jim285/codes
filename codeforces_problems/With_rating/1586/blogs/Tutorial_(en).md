# Tutorial_(en)

We hope all of you enjoyed the round! This round has been a long time in the making -- the oldest problem in it is H, which was actually originally proposed for the rounds that eventually became [Codeforces Round 655 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1372 "Codeforces Round 655 (Div. 2)") and [Codeforces Global Round 10](https://codeforces.com/contest/1392 "Codeforces Global Round 10").

The tutorial for E and implementations for all problems are now available.
