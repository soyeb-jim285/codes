# Announcement

Hello, Codeforces!

I'm glad to invite you to amazing (we've tried to make it such) [Codeforces Round 748 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1593 "Codeforces Round 748 (Div. 3)") which will start on [Wednesday, October 13, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=13&month=10&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This round is made by me ([MrPaul_TUser](https://codeforces.com/profile/MrPaul_TUser "Candidate Master MrPaul_TUser")), a significant contribution to the round was also made by [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") and [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "International Grandmaster BledDest").

The round contains 6-8 problems. The difficulties of the problems are expected to compose an interesting competition for participants with ratings up to 1600. However, all of you who wish to take part and have a rating 1600 or higher, can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round, it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks. We tried to make really strong tests â€” just like you will be surprised if many solutions fail after the contest is over.

You will be given **6-8 problems** and **2 hours 15 minutes** to solve them.

Note that **the penalty** for the wrong submission in this round (and the following Div. 3 rounds) is **10 minutes**.

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as trusted participants of the third division, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**
