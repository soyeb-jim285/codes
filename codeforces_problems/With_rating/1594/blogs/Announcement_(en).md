Γεια σου (Hello), Codeforces!

[Dremix10](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dremix10 "Master Dremix10") and I are glad to invite you to the first **Cypriot round** [Codeforces Round #747 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1594) which will take place on [Friday, October 8, 2021 at 21:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=8&month=10&year=2021&hour=18&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). **Note the unusual start time of the round**. As usual, **this round will be rated for participants with rating lower than 2100.**

Problems were created and prepared by [Dremix10](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dremix10 "Master Dremix10") and me. We tried to make them interesting, with short and clear statements. We hope that you will enjoy them!
