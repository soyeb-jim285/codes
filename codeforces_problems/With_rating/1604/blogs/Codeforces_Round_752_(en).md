আবার চলে এসেছি! (That's Bengali for "I am back! (in Terminator mode)")

I am super excited to invite you to participate in [Codeforces Round 752 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1603 "Codeforces Round 752 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 752 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1604 "Codeforces Round 752 (Div. 2)") which will be held on [Saturday, October 30, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=30&month=10&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This round is rated for both divisions.

You will be given 66 problems in each division and 22 hours to solve them. All the problems are authored and prepared by me.

I would like to thank -

* The great [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the amazing Codeforces and Polygon platforms.
* You, for existing and participating in the round. Also, thanks for giving your best and not quitting. You will eventually be happy [![blobheart](images/d7cc8b5ea81178880175de5a048032c05631f9b7.png)](https://codeforces.com/https://emoji.gg/emoji/8771_blobheart). Just hold right there.

The statements are short and directly ask you what to do and I have tried to make the pretests strong. I highly encourage you to read all the problems.

**Solve problems and help the poor!** Yes, you heard it right, this time you can help the world by just solving problems. I will donate money based on the solve count of each problem by the following measure:

 **Donation Per AC**
```cpp
Div2A - 0.005 USD
Div2B - 0.006 USD
Div2C/Div1A - 0.008 USD
Div2D/Div1B - 0.01 USD
Div2E/Div1C - 0.04 USD
Div2F/Div1D - 0.2 USD
Div1E - 2 USD
Div1F - 2 USD
```
The total estimated money is half of what I will get from Codeforces for this contest(but you can make it more by just solving more problems!). I am a student, so pardon me if that's too little.

Also, did you know that you can still upvote my [The Ultimate Topic List](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95106) blog and make it to the top?

Finally, I would like to dedicate this contest to me! I want to thank me for believing in me, for doing all this hard work, for trying to do more right than wrong. I want to thank me for just being me at all times.

Score distribution:   
 Div.1: 750−1000−1750−2500−3500−3750750−1000−1750−2500−3500−3750.   
 Div.2: 500−1000−1750−2000−2750−3500500−1000−1750−2000−2750−3500. 

Good Luck! Love you [![blobheart](images/d7cc8b5ea81178880175de5a048032c05631f9b7.png)](https://codeforces.com/https://emoji.gg/emoji/8771_blobheart).

5. [Graphcities](https://codeforces.com/profile/Graphcities "Newbie Graphcities")

**UPD:** Here is how the donation amount looks like:

 **Donation**
```cpp
Div2A - 0.005 * 9529 = 47.645 USD
Div2B - 0.006 * 6274 = 37.644 USD
Div2C/Div1A - 0.008 * (4012+967) = 39.832 USD
Div2D/Div1B - 0.01 * (2273+911) = 31.84 USD
Div2E/Div1C - 0.04 * (27+396) = 16.92 USD
Div2F/Div1D - 0.2 * (1+24) = 5 USD
Div1E - 2 * 8 = 16 USD
Div1F - 2 * 3 = 6 USD

Total - 200.881 USD
```
FYI I will get 400 USD for this contest. So the donation amount is indeed half of this as I have estimated before the contest, although didn't think that it would be this accurate. 

I will update you again when I get the money from Codeforces, more likely after a few months as I haven't received my previous contest's payment yet which happened 3 months ago!

Also, thanks for being a part of this. You have just helped someone who is in need (I mean after I distribute the money).
