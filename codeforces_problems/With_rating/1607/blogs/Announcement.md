# Announcement

Hello Codeforces!

Once again, we are glad to invite you all to [Codeforces Round 753 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1607 "Codeforces Round 753 (Div. 3)"), the third division round held on [Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=2&month=11&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This round was prepared (again) by me and [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov"). The problems are different but our anticipation is the same :) Hope you will like the problems we've prepared!

Big thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for great ideas as well as for helping me with writing good statements and better tests. I'm still a bit slow with some aspects of preparing problems so it's a really noticeable help for me. (UPD: as of this moment, it became much more noticeable, so, really, thanks a lot!)

Also special thanks for testing the round to [RisingWizard](https://codeforces.com/profile/RisingWizard "Expert RisingWizard"), [Capta1n_Shy](https://codeforces.com/profile/Capta1n_Shy "Expert Capta1n_Shy"), [Mazaalai](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mazaalai "Candidate Master Mazaalai"), [GustavoMG](https://codeforces.com/profile/GustavoMG "Master GustavoMG"), [nizamoff](https://codeforces.com/profile/nizamoff "Expert nizamoff"), [2020akadaver](https://codeforces.com/profile/2020akadaver "Expert 2020akadaver"), [ashmelev](https://codeforces.com/profile/ashmelev "Grandmaster ashmelev"), [p0kemanbr](https://codeforces.com/profile/p0kemanbr "Expert p0kemanbr"), [Kofta](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kofta "Expert Kofta") and, as usual, to [Gassa](https://codeforces.com/profile/Gassa "Master Gassa") for valuable comments! And last but not least, thanks to everyone who'll be participating! This round contains 8 problems and is expected to have a decent level of difficulty for participants with ratings up to 1600. However, all of you who wish to take part and have a rating 1600 or higher, can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round, it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks. We tried to make tests strong enough but it doesn't at all guarantee that open hacks phase will be pointless.

You will be given **8 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them. We remind you that the penalty for the wrong submission in this round (and the following Div. 3 rounds) is **10 minutes**. *Also please note* that the number of problems has slightly increased since the last edit.

Remember that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as trusted participants of the third division, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them)
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

Good luck to everyone!

**UPD:** [Editorial](Tutorial.md) is out!
