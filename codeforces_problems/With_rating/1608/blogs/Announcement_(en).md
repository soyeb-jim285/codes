Hello, Codeforces community!

I'm glad to invite you to Codeforces Round #758 (Div.1 + Div. 2), which will be held on [Saturday, December 11, 2021 at 16:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=11&month=12&year=2021&hour=13&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for both divisions. Note the **unusual start time**.
