Hello Codeforces!

We have a pleasure to invite you to [Good Bye 2021](https://codeforces.com/contests/1616), which will take place on [Wednesday, December 29, 2021 at 21:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=29&month=12&year=2021&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). You will have **2 hours** to solve the problems. The round will be rated for participants of both divisions.

The problems for this round were prepared by [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq"), with the help of excellent coordinators [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Legendary Grandmaster KAN") and [74TrAkToR](https://codeforces.com/profile/74TrAkToR "Grandmaster 74TrAkToR").

We would like to thank all the testers, who made this round possible: [gamegame](https://codeforces.com/profile/gamegame "Legendary Grandmaster gamegame"), [thenymphsofdelphi](https://codeforces.com/profile/thenymphsofdelphi "Grandmaster thenymphsofdelphi"), [ko_osaga](https://codeforces.com/profile/ko_osaga "Legendary Grandmaster ko_osaga"), [golions](https://codeforces.com/profile/golions "Candidate Master golions"), [Ashishgup](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ashishgup "Grandmaster Ashishgup"), [izban](https://codeforces.com/profile/izban "International Grandmaster izban"), [prabowo](https://codeforces.com/profile/prabowo "Grandmaster prabowo"), [74TrAkToR](https://codeforces.com/profile/74TrAkToR "Grandmaster 74TrAkToR"), [Devil](https://codeforces.com/profile/Devil "International Master Devil"), [manish.17](https://codeforces.com/profile/manish.17 "Candidate Master manish.17"), [taran_1407](https://codeforces.com/profile/taran_1407 "Candidate Master taran_1407"), [minhcool](https://codeforces.com/profile/minhcool "International Master minhcool"), [AlFlen](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlFlen "Master AlFlen"), [Utkarsh.25dec](https://codeforces.com/profile/Utkarsh.25dec "Master Utkarsh.25dec"), [NemanjaSo2005](https://codeforces.com/profile/NemanjaSo2005 "Expert NemanjaSo2005"), [wxhtzdy](https://codeforces.com/profile/wxhtzdy "Master wxhtzdy"), [ajit](https://codeforces.com/profile/ajit "Master ajit"), [mnaeraxr](https://codeforces.com/profile/mnaeraxr "Grandmaster mnaeraxr"), [Scrubpai](https://codeforces.com/profile/Scrubpai "Expert Scrubpai"), [YashDwivedi](https://codeforces.com/profile/YashDwivedi "Specialist YashDwivedi"), [eatmore](https://codeforces.com/profile/eatmore "International Grandmaster eatmore")!

And of course, [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for great platforms Codeforces and Polygon.

This round is supported by NEAR, a company founded by former competitor [AlexSkidanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlexSkidanov "International Master AlexSkidanov"). NEAR is built by many prominent competitive programmers, including twice ICPC champion [eatmore](https://codeforces.com/profile/eatmore "International Grandmaster eatmore") and GCJ and TCO winner [Egor](https://codeforces.com/profile/Egor "International Grandmaster Egor").

The participants who end up in the first 255 positions will receive prizes. The participant on the first place will receive Ⓝ128, the next two participants will receive Ⓝ64, the next four participants will receive Ⓝ32, etc.

NEAR is a modern blockchain protocol and a development platform. NEAR applications have digital assets as a first class concept, and are hosted in a way that anyone can ascertain the correctness of their execution. This allows building applications that by design provide users with ownership over their assets, data and the power of governance.

If you want to try building on top of NEAR, join Metabuild, a hackathon running until February with $1M in prizes: [https://metabuild.devpost.com/](https://codeforces.com/https://metabuild.devpost.com/)

We hope you will enjoy the problem set! Good luck!

Congratulations the winners!
