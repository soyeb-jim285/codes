# Announcement

Hello, Codeforces!

On [Tuesday, December 14, 2021 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=14&month=12&year=2021&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) the [Codeforces Round 760 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1618 "Codeforces Round 760 (Div. 3)") will start. This is a usual round for the participants from the third division. The round will contain 8 problems, which are mostly suited for participants with rating below 1600 (or we hope so). Although, as usual, participants with rating of 1600 and greater can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks (we hope that our tests are strong enough, so there won't be too many solutions hacked during this phase). 

You will have to solve **8 problems** in **2 hours and 15 minutes**. The penalty for a wrong submission is equal to **10 minutes**.

[We remind you](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only *the trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. As it is written on the blog which you can access by this link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as *a trusted participant of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are *a trusted participant of the third division* or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

The problems were prepared by [Brovko](https://codeforces.com/profile/Brovko "International Master Brovko"), [shnirelman](https://codeforces.com/profile/shnirelman "Master shnirelman"), [Lankin](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lankin "Expert Lankin"), [awoo](https://codeforces.com/profile/awoo "Grandmaster awoo") and me.
