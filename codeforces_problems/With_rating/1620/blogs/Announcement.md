*Hello once again, Codeforces!* 

*Almost 5 months have passed since we organized the Harbour.Space Scholarship Contest 2021-2022. Itâ€™s been quite a tough challenge with more than 15,000 participants. However, we were able to select the ones who were ready to take the opportunity and join Harbour.Space this year. In addition to the contest, we carefully reviewed all scholarship applications and awarded a total of 11 students.*

*We would like to introduce you our Competitive Programming Scholarship Winners who have already arrived to Barcelona:*
