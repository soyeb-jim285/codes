Hello, Codeforces!

We invite you to [Codeforces Round #765 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1625), which will take place in [Wednesday, January 12, 2022 at 18:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=12&month=1&year=2022&hour=15&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). Note the unusual contest start time. **This round will be rated for all the participants whose ratings are lower than 2100.**

You will have to solve 5 problems in 2 hours. One of the problems will be divided into easy and hard version. The round is based on the problems from Belarusian Regional olympiad. **We kindly ask all Belarusian pupils who participated in this olympiad, to refrain from taking part in this round and discussing the problems publicly before the round ends.**
