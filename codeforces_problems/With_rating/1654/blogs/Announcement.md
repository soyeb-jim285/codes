For those who want to compete on the same problems, we will hold a regular Codeforces Round, combined for both divisions. The round is starting at [Sunday, March 20, 2022 at 17:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=20&month=3&year=2022&hour=14&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

**If you are a participant of the official Technocup Finals, you are not allowed to take part in the round 778. We ask participants of the official Finals not to discuss the problems in open media till evening.**
