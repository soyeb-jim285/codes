Here is information from our partners:

*Hello, Codeforces!*

![](images/ce9f87d5c429f47e7691bef3a8934ebf36af3f15.jpg)

*We, the TON Foundation team, are pleased to support the CodeTON round and invite you to the TON Smart Challenge 1 competition, which will be held on our platform.*

*The Open Network (TON) is a fully decentralized blockchain created by the Telegram team for a mass audience.*

*The TON protocol was designed by Nikolai Durov — who is a two-time ICPC world champion, a three-time [IMO gold medalist](https://codeforces.com/https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=4194&language=en), a multiple [IOI medalist](https://codeforces.com/https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/1706), and a co-founder of Telegram — and other winners of international competitions. Now TON is being developed by a community of independent developers and teams.*

*The winners of CodeTON Round 1 will receive valuable prizes.*

*The first 1,000 participants will receive prizes in TON cryptocurrency:*

 * *1st place: 1,000 TON*
* *2–3 places: 600 TON each*
* *4–10 places: 100 TON each*
* *11–100 places: 15 TON each*
* *101–1,000 places: 8 TON each*

*Also, the top 15 participants of CodeTON Round 1 will receive branded hoodies.*

*In addition, a separate TON Smart Challenge 1 contest will start on our platform on March 28. We invite you to join this competition as well.*

*You can read more about this competition here:*

   [TON Smart Challenge 1 →](https://codeforces.com/https://t.me/toncontests/25) *We believe that the problems of optimizing the efficiency of smart contract code execution on the TON blockchain may be of interest to participants in algorithmic competitions. The development of smart contracts is a case where the experience of optimization earns money by definition because a network fee is paid for each operation on the blockchain.*

*We wish you good luck at CodeTON Round 1 and hope to see you among the TON Smart Challenge participants!*
