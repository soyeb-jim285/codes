Hello.

In the meantime, the onsite event has already begun. You can follow the results at the link [https://nerc.itmo.ru/archive/2021/standings.html](https://codeforces.com/https://nerc.itmo.ru/archive/2021/standings.html) (refrain from viewing if you want to plan to write a mirror and want the conditions as close as possible to the participants in the competition).

There is great news. This year it was possible to get together without any online participation. Teams write from one computer! Good old ICPC.

And I suggest you join the online mirror. It is designed for team participation by those who have passed the qualifying competitions. Ready to try? Use the link: [2021-2022 ICPC, NERC, Northern Eurasia Onsite (Unrated, Online Mirror, ICPC Rules, Teams Preferred)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1666 "2021-2022 ICPC, NERC, Northern Eurasia Onsite (Unrated, Online Mirror, ICPC Rules, Teams Preferred)").

Good luck!
