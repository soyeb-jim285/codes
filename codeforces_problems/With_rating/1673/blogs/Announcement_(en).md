Hello Codeforces,

I invite you to participate in [Codeforces Round 785 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1673 "Codeforces Round 785 (Div. 2)") which will be held on [Saturday, April 30, 2022 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=30&month=4&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). **The round will be rated for participants of Division 2 with rating strictly less than 2100**. But as always, the participants of Division 1 are welcome to take part out of competition.

You will be given **6 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them. Moreover, there will be atleast 11 and atmost 10485761048576 interactive problems. So, you are advised to refer to the [guide on interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) in case you are not familiar with them.

I would like to thank the following people for their contribution to the round:

 * [Artyom123](https://codeforces.com/profile/Artyom123 "Grandmaster Artyom123") for his amazing coordination, helping me throughout the preparation of the round and translating the statements.
* [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik"), [Monogon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Monogon "Grandmaster Monogon"), [kclee2172](https://codeforces.com/profile/kclee2172 "International Grandmaster kclee2172"), [TheScrasse](https://codeforces.com/profile/TheScrasse "Grandmaster TheScrasse"), [yash_daga](https://codeforces.com/profile/yash_daga "International Master yash_daga"), [Sad_reacts_only](https://codeforces.com/profile/Sad_reacts_only "Master Sad_reacts_only"), [AlperenT](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlperenT "Master AlperenT"), [Utkarsh.25dec](https://codeforces.com/profile/Utkarsh.25dec "Master Utkarsh.25dec"), [abhidot](https://codeforces.com/profile/abhidot "Master abhidot"), [PR_0202](https://codeforces.com/profile/PR_0202 "Master PR_0202"), [towrist](https://codeforces.com/profile/towrist "Master towrist"), [Rubalien](https://codeforces.com/profile/Rubalien "Candidate Master Rubalien"), [hritik31](https://codeforces.com/profile/hritik31 "Expert hritik31"), [snowysecret](https://codeforces.com/profile/snowysecret "Expert snowysecret"), [alok_k6618](https://codeforces.com/profile/alok_k6618 "Expert alok_k6618") and [harsh2804](https://codeforces.com/profile/harsh2804 "Specialist harsh2804") for testing the round and providing their feedback.
* [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") for the great Codeforces and Polygon platforms.
* [NEAR](https://codeforces.com/https://near.org/) for supporting this round, details can be found in [this post](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/101398).
* You for participating.

This will be my second Codeforces round and based on the feedback by participants on [Round #730](https://codeforces.com/contest/1543), I have implemented the following changes:

 * The round will have no theme. I have tried to keep the problem statements as short and to the point as possible.
* The pretests have been made stronger (specifically, more pretests have been included).
* I have tried to keep the samples and their explanation as useful as possible.
* No floating-point precision issues this time.
* The I/O constraints for the interactive problem(s) have been kept low to provide a fair ground to the languages with slower I/O.

The score distribution will be released strictly before the round and the editorial will be released strictly after the round.

Good luck and have fun!

 **Disclaimer**No powers of 2 were harmed during the making of this round. Always remember that 1048576 is the most superior power of 2.

**UPD: The score distribution is 500−750−1500−2000−2750−3250500−750−1500−2000−2750−3250.**
