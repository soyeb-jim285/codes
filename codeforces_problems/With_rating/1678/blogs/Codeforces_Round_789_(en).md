Here are some things I personally want to say. This is my second round. Three years have passed since the first round [round 573](https://codeforces.com/contests/1190,1191) I held. Now I have graduated and worked. I like codeforces very much. Though I have already participated in work, haven't trained for a long time, my ability has degraded a lot, I will still come to codeforces to participate in the contest in my spare time. This time I also prepared some problems to propose a round, but for some reasons, most of them were rejected. In particular, one of my favorite problems was rejected because "many testers don't like it". I'm a little frustrated, but I also understand that the coordinator's job is to make the round better and more people like this round. I think it's a great honor to prepare round on codeforces and let so many people around the world try to solve the problem I prepared. I will accumulate some more interesting ideas for the next round and try to make more people like the problems I prepared. 

I'd like to express my great gratitude to my friends for preparing this round with me, I don't think I can prepare this round alone without them. I really appreciate having the support of my good friends in my round. 

In addition, the three naughty cats mentioned in the statement.(*=｀ω´=)ﾉ I understand that I shouldn't post pictures irrelevant to the statement, so I post it here ↓

Finally, I hope you like the problems in this round, good luck and have fun!(≧ω≦)/

The score distribution will soon be published.

**UPD1: Although our coordinator allows to post the PDF of Chinese statements in the contest material, it seems that codeforces does not allow it. We are only allowed to post something after the round. So we will still post Chinese tutorials after the round.**

**UPD2**: List of contributors is a bit changed, and the score distribution will be:

 * Div.2: **500 — (750 + 1000) — 1250 — 2000 — 2000 — 2750**
* Div.1: **500 — 1250 — 1250 — 2000 — 2500 — 3500**

**UPD3: Note that the score of the last problem of Div.1 has changed, 4000 → 3500.**

**UPD4**: [Editorial](Tutorial_1_(en).md) is out, and Chinese Tutorial will soon be published.

**UPD5**: [Chinese Tutorial](https://codeforces.com/contest/1678/attachments/download/16089/Codeforces%20Round%20789%20Chinese%20Tutorial.pdf) is out.

**UPD6**: Congratulations to the winners!
