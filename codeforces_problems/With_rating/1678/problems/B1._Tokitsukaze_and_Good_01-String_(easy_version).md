<h1 style='text-align: center;'> B1. Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String (easy version)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 1 second</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.

Tokitsukaze has a binary string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of zeros and ones, $n$ is even.

Now Tokitsukaze divides $s$ into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same. After that, $s$ is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.

For example, if $s$ is "11001111", it will be divided into "11", "00" and "1111". Their lengths are $2$, $2$, $4$ respectively, which are all even numbers, so "11001111" is good. Another example, if $s$ is "1110011000", it will be divided into "111", "00", "11" and "000", and their lengths are $3$, $2$, $2$, $3$. Obviously, "1110011000" is not good.

Tokitsukaze wants to make $s$ good by changing the values of some positions in $s$. Specifically, she can perform the operation any number of times: change the value of $s_i$ to '0' or '1'($1 \leq i \leq n$). Can you tell her the minimum number of operations to make $s$ good?

### Input

The first contains a single positive integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$) — the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of $s$, it is guaranteed that $n$ is even.

The second line contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of zeros and ones.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line with one integer — the minimum number of operations to make $s$ good.

## Example

### Input


```text
51011100110008110011112002116100110
```
### Output

```text

3
0
0
0
3

```
## Note

In the first test case, one of the ways to make $s$ good is the following.

Change $s_3$, $s_6$ and $s_7$ to '0', after that $s$ becomes "1100000000", it can be divided into "11" and "00000000", which lengths are $2$ and $8$ respectively. There are other ways to operate $3$ times to make $s$ good, such as "1111110000", "1100001100", "1111001100".

In the second, third and fourth test cases, $s$ is good initially, so no operation is required.
