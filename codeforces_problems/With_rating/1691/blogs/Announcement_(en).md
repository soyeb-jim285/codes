### PRIZES

The following twenty lucky participants receive a T-shirt:

 * Top 10 Indian participants.
* Random 10 from top 100 (ranks 11-100) Indian participants.

These ranks are determined from the combined unofficial rank list. People who have their Country set to India in their CF profile will qualify as Indian participants. 

We are giving T-shirts to Indian participants only to avoid logistic issues that we have to face during international delivery. We apologize for this limitation, we will try our best to bring international prizes too from next year.
