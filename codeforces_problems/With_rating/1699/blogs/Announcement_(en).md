# Announcement_(en)

Hello, Codeforces! Or, as we like to say in Romania: *Noi nu spunem asa ceva, Codeforces!*

We are proud to finally invite you to participate in [Codeforces Round #804](Announcement_(en).md), which will start on [Monday, July 4th, 2022, 14:35 UTC](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=7&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) You will be given **5** problems and **2** hours to solve them. We greatly recommend to read all the problems, statements are very short and straight to the point.

In this round, the theme is not Independance Day related. I know, maybe we should've made the theme "Freedom", but we are not Americans and the puns within the problems were already written. 

Joining me on the problem setting panel are:
