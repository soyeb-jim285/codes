Hello, **Codeforces**! ü§ó

We are happy to invite you to participate in [COMPFEST 14 Preliminary Online Mirror (Unrated, ICPC Rules, Teams Preferred)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1725) on [Sunday, September 4, 2022 at 19:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=4&month=9&year=2022&hour=16&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). COMPFEST is a national **ICPC-style contest** for university students in Indonesia.

The contest will last for **5 hours** and consist of **13 problems**. While it is preferred to participate in a team, individual participation is also allowed. The problems themselves are expected to be easier than ICPC Regional contest. 

COMPFEST itself is an annual event hosted by Universitas Indonesia. It is the largest student-run IT event in Indonesia and competitive programming contest is one of the competitions hosted.

We hope you will enjoy and have fun in the contest. Good luck!!
