Hi, Codeforces!

Three years later, first ideas of a contest turned into this complete set of problems, so I am glad to invite you to take part in [Codeforces Round #824 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1735), which will take place on [Sunday, October 2, 2022 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=2&month=10&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100. Participants from the first division are also welcomed to take part out of competition.

You will be given **2 hours 15 minutes** to solve **6 problems**. All the problems were created and prepared by me.
