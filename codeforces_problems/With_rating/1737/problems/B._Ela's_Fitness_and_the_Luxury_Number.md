|  | While working at DTL, Ela is very aware of her physical and mental health. She started to practice various sports, such as Archery, Yoga, and Football. |

Since she started engaging in sports activities, Ela switches to trying a new sport on days she considers being "Luxury" days. She counts the days since she started these activities, in which the day she starts is numbered as day $1$. A "Luxury" day is the day in which the number of this day is a luxurious number. 

An integer $x$ is called a luxurious number if it is divisible by ${\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor}$.

Here $\lfloor r \rfloor$ denotes the "floor" of a real number $r$. In other words, it's the largest integer not greater than $r$.

For example: $8$, $56$, $100$ are luxurious numbers, since $8$ is divisible by $\lfloor \sqrt{8} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.8284 \rfloor = 2$, $56$ is divisible $\lfloor \sqrt{56} \rfloor = \lfloor 7.4833 \rfloor = 7$, and $100$ is divisible by $\lfloor \sqrt{100} \rfloor = \lfloor 10 \rfloor = 10$, respectively. On the other hand $5$, $40$ are not, since $5$ are not divisible by $\lfloor \sqrt{5} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.2361 \rfloor = 2$, and $40$ are not divisible by $\lfloor \sqrt{40} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.3246 \rfloor = 6$.

Being a friend of Ela, you want to engage in these fitness activities with her to keep her and yourself accompanied (and have fun together, of course). Between day $l$ and day $r$, you want to know how many times she changes the activities.

### Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line has the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\ 000$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le 10^{18}$) â€” the intervals at which you want to know how many times Ela changes her sports.

### Output

For each test case, output an integer that denotes the answer.

## Example

### Input

```
### Output

```text

```
## Note

In the first test case, $5$ luxury numbers in range $[8, 19]$ are: $8, 9, 12, 15, 16$.
