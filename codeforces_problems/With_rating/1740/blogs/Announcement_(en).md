We will try to post the editorials as soon as possible. Please stay tuned!

**UPD 2** : [Editorial](Tutorial_(en).md)

We are very sorry for the late editorial. We did not anticipate the workload of maintaining an onsite contest, especially since this is the first onsite contest held by our university in three years. We will use this experience to learn and improve our preparation next time. 

Finally, we are delighted that the contest ran very well and that many of the contestants are enjoying the contest.

See you next year! ü•∞ü•∞
