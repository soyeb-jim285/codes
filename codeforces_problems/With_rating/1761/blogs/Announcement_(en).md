Hello, Codeforces!

Members of team EZEC are glad to invite you to participate in **[Pinely Round 1 (Div. 1 + Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1761)**, which will start on **[Sunday, November 20, 2022 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=20&month=11&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166)**. You will be given **7** problems, **one of which has a subtask**, and **2 hours and 30 minutes** to solve them. The round will be rated for everyone. It is greatly recommended to read all the problems.

There is at least one interactive problem, so please see the [guide of interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) if you are unfamiliar with it.

We would also like to thank:

* Our great emperor [antontrygubO_o](https://codeforces.com/profile/antontrygubO_o "International Grandmaster antontrygubO_o") for cooperating and coordinating with us to make this round happen. He saved the round by contributing his problem when a problem was found similar to an existing problem.
