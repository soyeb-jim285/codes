To destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent $n$ monsters to Earth's surface. The $i$-th monster has health $h_i$ and power $p_i$.

With his last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal $k$ damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the health of all monsters by $k$ (if $k > 0$) with a single attack. 

However, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their combined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the $^\dagger$weakest monster $^\ddagger$alive. In other words, the minimum $p_i$ among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the value of $k$ after each attack.

$^\dagger$The Weakest monster is the one with the least power.

$^\ddagger$A monster is alive if its health is strictly greater than $0$.

Will Genos be successful in killing all the monsters?

### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 10^5$) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing $n$ integers describing the arrays $h$ and $p$ ($1 \le h_i, p_i \le 10^9$).

It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

### Output

For each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and "NO" otherwise.

## Example

### Input


```text
36 718 5 13 9 10 12 7 2 1 2 63 45 5 54 4 43 22 1 31 1 1
```
### Output

```text

YES
NO
YES

```
## Note

In the first example, after Genos' first attack, $h$ and $k$ will update to: 

* $h: [11,0,6,2,3,0]$
* $k: 7-1 = 6$

 After second attack: * $h: [5,0,0,0,0,0]$
* $k: 6-2 = 4$

 After third attack: * $h: [1,0,0,0,0,0]$
* $k: 4-2 = 2$

 After fourth attack: * $h: [0,0,0,0,0,0]$

 As Genos could kill all monsters, the answer is YES.
