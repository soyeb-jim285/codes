Hello Codeforces!![](images/2ee2f0f95f05aae6ca6f47812dae2dc2aabf277b.png)

On [Saturday, November 26, 2022 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=26&month=11&year=2022&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) we will host [Codeforces Global Round 24](https://codeforces.com/contest/1764 "Codeforces Global Round 24"). **Note the unusual time of the round.** 

It is the sixth round of a 2022 series of [Codeforces Global Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65002). The rounds are open and rated for everybody.

The prizes for this round:

 * 30 best participants get a t-shirt.
* 20 t-shirts are randomly distributed among those with ranks between 31 and 500, inclusive.

The prizes for the 6-round series in 2022:

 * In each round top-100 participants get points according to the [table](https://codeforces.com/https://pastebin.com/QT5sXEaT).
* The final result for each participant is equal to the sum of points he gets in the four rounds he placed the highest.
* The best 20 participants over all series get sweatshirts and place certificates.

Thanks to XTX, which in 2022 supported the global rounds initiative!
