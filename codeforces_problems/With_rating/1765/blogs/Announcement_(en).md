Hello Codeforces!

The Southern and Volga Russian Regional Contest was held in Saratov State University on 22nd of November. This contest was used to qualify the teams from Southern Russia and Volga region to the Northern Eurasia Finals.

On [Sunday, November 27, 2022 at 16:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=27&month=11&year=2022&hour=13&min=35&sec=0&p1=166), we will conduct the online mirror of this contest. It will last for *5 hours* and is best suited for *teams of three people*, although it is not forbidden to participate in teams of smaller/larger size. The mirror will use ICPC rules, the same as the offline contest.

I would like to express my gratitude to all other jury members: [awoo](https://codeforces.com/profile/awoo "Grandmaster awoo"), [Neon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Neon "Candidate Master Neon"), [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Master vovuh"), [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "International Master adedalic"), [DmitryKlenov](https://codeforces.com/profile/DmitryKlenov "Expert DmitryKlenov"), [dmitryme](https://codeforces.com/profile/dmitryme "Unrated, dmitryme"), [DStepanenko](https://codeforces.com/profile/DStepanenko "Expert DStepanenko"), [elena](https://codeforces.com/profile/elena "Unrated, elena") and [kuviman](https://codeforces.com/profile/kuviman "Master kuviman").

As a chief judge of the contest, I hope you enjoy the problems!

Of course, the contest will be *unrated*.
