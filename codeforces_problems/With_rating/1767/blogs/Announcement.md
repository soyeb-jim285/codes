Hello Codeforces!

On [Friday, December 16, 2022 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=12&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) [Educational Codeforces Round 140 (Rated for Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1767 "Educational Codeforces Round 140 (Rated for Div. 2)") will start.

Series of Educational Rounds continue being held as [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) initiative! You can read the details about the cooperation between [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) and Codeforces in the [blog post](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/51208).

This round will be **rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100**. It will be held on extended ICPC rules. The penalty for each incorrect submission until the submission with a full solution is 10 minutes. After the end of the contest you will have 12 hours to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.

You will be given **6 or 7 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them.

The problems were invented and prepared by Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "International Master adedalic") Dalabaev, Vladimir [vovuh](https://codeforces.com/profile/vovuh "Master vovuh") Petrov, Ivan [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "International Grandmaster BledDest") Androsov, Maksim [Neon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Neon "Candidate Master Neon") Mescheryakov, Alexey [shnirelman](https://codeforces.com/profile/shnirelman "Grandmaster shnirelman") Shnirelman and me. Also huge thanks to Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for great systems Polygon and Codeforces.

Good luck to all the participants!
