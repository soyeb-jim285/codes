# Announcement

Привет, Codeforces!

On [Sunday, December 18, 2022 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=12&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166), [Codeforces Round 839 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1772 "Codeforces Round 839 (Div. 3)") will start. This is a usual round for the participants from the third division. The round will contain 7 problems, which are mostly suited for participants with rating below 1600 (or we hope so). Although, as usual, participants with rating of 1600 and greater can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks.

You will be given **7 problems** and **2 hours and 15 minutes** to solve them. The penalty for a wrong submission is equal to **10 minutes**.

[We remind you](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the *trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. As it is written on the blog which you can access by this link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participant of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

The problems were invented and prepared by Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "International Master adedalic") Dalabaev, Ivan [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "International Grandmaster BledDest") Androsov, Maksim [Neon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Neon "Candidate Master Neon") Mescheryakov and me. We would like to thank the testers of the round: [ermukanoff](https://codeforces.com/profile/ermukanoff "Pupil ermukanoff"), [soup](https://codeforces.com/profile/soup "Newbie soup"), [lankin.i](https://codeforces.com/profile/lankin.i "Specialist lankin.i"), [Fanarill](https://codeforces.com/profile/Fanarill "Pupil Fanarill"), [stAngel](https://codeforces.com/profile/stAngel "Newbie stAngel") and [senjougaharin](https://codeforces.com/profile/senjougaharin "Master senjougaharin").
