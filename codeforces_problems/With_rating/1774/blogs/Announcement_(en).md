This is our third round! Although you may find members in our team and testers who helped are not the same as the past, our permanent love and enthusiasm for coding will not change. Conspicuously, great efforts have been put in it. We are sincerely looking forward to your participation and we hope everyone will enjoy it. Besides, this round is sponsored, which indicates that everyone has an opportunity to get the prize!

**UPD1: Here is the score distribution:**

**500 — 1000 — 1500 — 1500 — 2000 — (1500 + 1000) — 3250 — 4000**

UPD2: Sorry to everyone! We must apologize because the pretest of B is not strong, leading to FST for many people. It is our fault! We don't want to make excuses. This time, we did a bad job and let everyone down. We all blamed ourselves sadly. Although we have invited a lot of testers but most of them passed all the tests, and even some of them get 'WA', they fixed their code and passed it. So we didn't pay too much attention to it -- we thought it was 'normal'. However, we didn't suppose the pretests were so weak that lots of participants get FST. Sorry again! (>_<)

And personally, firstly, I must apologize to all of you. I let you down this time. I blamed myself sadly. And I accept all the critical opinions. However, secondly, I know that you must feel angry when you find your B got FST, and that's all our fault, but because my birthday is coming, I intended to use this contest to record the growth of me and my team members, as well as my happy memories on codeforces, so could you please don't scold me too harshly when criticizing me? (Actually I am crying when typing this words; I blamed myself sadly when I saw lots of FST). I will regard all your comments as the most valuable things which urge me to become a better person and help me grow to a more mature person, but maybe I will be very painful if I see comments or messages as 'you are a trash''trash round'. (⑉꒦ິ^꒦ິ⑉)

Sorry! We did a bad job because of our carelessness this time, but we promise we will try our best to improve our comprehensive abilities, and bring a better round next time! We will keep in mind every word of encouragement and criticism, which is the driving force for our growth. Wish you happy everyday! (•ω•)

**UPD3: [Tutorial](Tutorial_(en).md) is available.** 

Thanks for all the warmth and kindness!!! I felt deeply guilty during the past few hours, now I feel better. I really appreciate your warmth and kindness!!! (●'◡'●)

We made the contest just because we would like to share our interesting ideas with you. If you like any of the ideas, we will be very delighted!!! o(≥ω≤)o
