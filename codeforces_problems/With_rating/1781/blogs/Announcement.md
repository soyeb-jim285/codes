# Announcement

Hello!

Welcome to the [Codeforces Round 844 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, based on VK Cup 2022 - Elimination Round)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1782) that will start on [Sunday, January 15, 2023 at 18:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=1&year=2023&hour=15&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). It will be a combined rated round for both divisions and open to everyone.

This round is a mirror of VK Cup 2022 Elimination â€” annual programming championship for Russian-speaking competitors organized by VK. VK Cup [started in 2012](https://codeforces.com/vkcup2012) and has grown to be a five-track competition in competitive programming, Mobile, ML, Go, and JavaScript.

All the problems are authored and prepared by me. Thanks to [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Legendary Grandmaster KAN"), [errorgorn](https://codeforces.com/profile/errorgorn "International Grandmaster errorgorn"), [lperovskaya](https://codeforces.com/profile/lperovskaya "Specialist lperovskaya"), [dario2994](https://codeforces.com/profile/dario2994 "International Grandmaster dario2994"), [Monogon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Monogon "Grandmaster Monogon"), [Arpa](https://codeforces.com/profile/Arpa "International Master Arpa") for making this round better.
