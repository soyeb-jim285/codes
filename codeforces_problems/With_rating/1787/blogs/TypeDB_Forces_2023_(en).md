**About Vaticle & TypeDB**

Vaticle is a team of people driven to empower engineers to solve complex problems. We are the creators of the strongly-typed database, [TypeDB](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/vaticle/typedb), and its query language, [TypeQL](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/vaticle/typeql). TypeDB is a strongly-typed database with a rich and logical type system. TypeDB empowers you to solve complex problems, using TypeQL as its query language. TypeDB provides a strong type system for developers to break down complex problems into meaningful and logical systems. Through TypeQL, TypeDB provides powerful abstractions over low-level and complex data patterns. From financial analytics to drug discovery, cyber threat detection to robotics disaster recovery,TypeDB empowers engineers around the world to tackle a higher order of complexity in data and knowledge.

We've built a pioneering developer community of 13,000+ engineers, spread over 20 countries, and counting. To continue pursuing this vision, we need to build a team of individuals who are not just the best and brightest in what they do, but are also driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for the world.
