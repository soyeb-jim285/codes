<h1 style='text-align: center;'> E1. Unforgivable Curse (easy version)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 1 second</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

This is an easy version of the problem. In this version, $k$ is always $3$.

The chief wizard of the Wizengamot once caught the evil wizard Drahyrt, but the evil wizard has returned and wants revenge on the chief wizard. So he stole spell $s$ from his student Harry.

The spell — is a $n$-length string of lowercase Latin letters.

Drahyrt wants to replace spell with an unforgivable curse — string $t$.

Drahyrt, using ancient magic, can swap letters at a distance $k$ or $k+1$ in spell as many times as he wants. In this version of the problem, you can swap letters at a distance of $3$ or $4$. In other words, Drahyrt can change letters in positions $i$ and $j$ in spell $s$ if $|i-j|=3$ or $|i-j|=4$.

For example, if $s = $ "talant" and $t = $ "atltna", Drahyrt can act as follows:

* swap the letters at positions $1$ and $4$ to get spell "aaltnt".
* swap the letters at positions $2$ and $6$ to get spell "atltna".

You are given spells $s$ and $t$. Can Drahyrt change spell $s$ to $t$?

### Input

The first line of input gives a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test.

Descriptions of the test cases are follow.

The first line contains two integers $n, k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $k = 3$) — the length spells and the number $k$ such that Drahyrt can change letters in a spell at a distance $k$ or $k+1$.

The second line gives spell $s$ — a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The third line gives spell $t$ — a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ values over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. 
## Note

 that there is no limit on the sum of $k$ values over all test cases.

### Output

For each test case, output on a separate line "YES" if Drahyrt can change spell $s$ to $t$ and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, lines "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as positive answer).

## Example

### Input


```text
76 3talantatltna7 3abacabaaaaabbc12 3abracadabraaavadakedavra5 3acciocicao5 3lumosmolus4 3uwjttwju4 3kvpxvxpk
```
### Output

```text

YES
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO

```
## Note

The first example is explained in the condition.

In the second example we can proceed as follows:

* Swap the letters at positions $2$ and $5$ (distance $3$), then we get the spell "aaacbba".
* Swap the letters at positions $4$ and $7$ (distance $3$), then you get the spell "aaaabbc".

In the third example, we can show that it is impossible to get the string $t$ from the string $s$ by swapping the letters at a distance of $3$ or $4$.

In the fourth example, for example, the following sequence of transformations is appropriate:

* "accio" $\rightarrow$ "aocic" $\rightarrow$ "cocia" $\rightarrow$ "iocca" $\rightarrow$ "aocci" $\rightarrow$ "aicco" $\rightarrow$ "cicao"

In the fifth example, you can show that it is impossible to get the string $s$ from the string $t$.

In the sixth example, it is enough to swap the two outermost letters.
