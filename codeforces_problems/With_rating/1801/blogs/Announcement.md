Open Olympiad consists of the most interesting and hard problems that are proposed by a wide community of authors, so we decided to conduct a Codeforces regular round based on it, which will happen on [Thursday, March 9, 2023 at 15:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=9&month=3&year=2023&hour=12&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) and will be based on **both** days of the Olympiad. **Note the unusual time of the round.** Each division will have 7 problems and 3 hours to solve them.

**We kindly ask all the community members that are going to participate in the competition to show sportsmanship by not trying to cheat in any manner, in particular, by trying to figure out problem statements from the onsite participants. If you end up knowing some of the problems of Moscow Open Olympiad (by participating in it, from some of the onsite contestants or in any other way), please do not participate in the round. We also ask onsite contestants to not discuss problems in public. Failure to comply with any of the rules above may result in a disqualification.**
