# Codeforces_Round_869_(en)

Hi everyone!

It's been a while since I set problems for Codeforces competitions, so I hope that you had sufficient opportunity to rest before dealing with my problems again. Oh, no-no, there's nothing to worry about! Probably! I promise!

[jeroenodb](https://codeforces.com/profile/jeroenodb "Grandmaster jeroenodb") and [adamant](https://codeforces.com/profile/adamant "Master adamant") (that's me!) are happy to invite you to [Codeforces Round 869 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1817 "Codeforces Round 869 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 869 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1818 "Codeforces Round 869 (Div. 2)") which are going to take place at [Saturday, April 29, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=29&month=4&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). Participants with a rating strictly lower than 1900 will participate in Division 2, while participants with a rating of at least 1900 will participate in Division 1.

All the problems are prepared by us, and we would like to thank:
