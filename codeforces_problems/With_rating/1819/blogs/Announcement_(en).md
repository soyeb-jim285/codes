Hello, Codeforces!

This Saturday VIII Lipetsk Team Olympiad, a competition for high school students from all over the country, will be held in Lipetsk. Maybe you participated in previous Codeforces rounds based on our problems (rounds [643](https://codeforces.com/contest/1355) and [791](https://codeforces.com/contest/1679)).

The round will start at [Saturday, April 15, 2023 at 15:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=4&year=2023&hour=12&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) and will last for 2 hours. **Please notice the unusual time.** Each division will have 6 problems. The round will be held according to the Codeforces rules and will be rated for both divisions.

Problems were proposed and prepared by [Um_nik](https://codeforces.com/profile/Um_nik "Legendary Grandmaster Um_nik"), [DishonoredRighteous](https://codeforces.com/profile/DishonoredRighteous "Grandmaster DishonoredRighteous"), [FairyWinx](https://codeforces.com/profile/FairyWinx "Grandmaster FairyWinx"), [golikovnik](https://codeforces.com/profile/golikovnik "Grandmaster golikovnik"), [teraqqq](https://codeforces.com/profile/teraqqq "International Grandmaster teraqqq"), [grphil](https://codeforces.com/profile/grphil "Master grphil"), [Kon567889](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kon567889 "Master Kon567889"), [TeaTime](https://codeforces.com/profile/TeaTime "Master TeaTime"), [Tikhon228](https://codeforces.com/profile/Tikhon228 "Master Tikhon228") and [dshindov](https://codeforces.com/profile/dshindov "Candidate Master dshindov").
