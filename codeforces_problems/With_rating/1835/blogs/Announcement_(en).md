Hi, Codeforces!

I have the pleasure of inviting you to participate in [Codeforces Round 880 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1835) and [Codeforces Round 880 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1836), which will start on [Sunday, June 18, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=6&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). You will be given **6** problems and **2 hours** to solve them in both divisions.

The problems were authored and prepared by [Arti1990](https://codeforces.com/profile/Arti1990 "Candidate Master Arti1990"), [Okrut](https://codeforces.com/profile/Okrut "Grandmaster Okrut"), [w0nsh](https://codeforces.com/profile/w0nsh "Grandmaster w0nsh"), [kempusss](https://codeforces.com/profile/kempusss "Master kempusss"), [Fly_37](https://codeforces.com/profile/Fly_37 "Master Fly_37"), [kobor](https://codeforces.com/profile/kobor "International Master kobor"), [maras](https://codeforces.com/profile/maras "Master maras"), and me. As the tasks are based on problems from Polish Championship in Team Programming for High School, which takes place earlier on the same day, participants from the original competition are asked not to participate in this round nor share the problems.
