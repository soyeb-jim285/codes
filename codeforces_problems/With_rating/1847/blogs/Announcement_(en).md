Hi Codeforces! 

I welcome everyone to participate in [Codeforces Round 882 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1847 "Codeforces Round 882 (Div. 2)") which will start on [Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=7&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The round will be rated for participants of Division 2 with a rating lower than 2100. I would encourage Division 1 participants to participate in the round unofficially. 

You will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. One of the problem is interactive, so please read [guide for interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) if you are not familiar with it.

 **the theme of the contest is**Read problem statements to know which anime :)
