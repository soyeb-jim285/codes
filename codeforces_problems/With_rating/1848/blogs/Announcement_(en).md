I and [pavlekn](https://codeforces.com/profile/pavlekn "Candidate Master pavlekn") are glad to invite everyone to participate in [Codeforces Round 885 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1848 "Codeforces Round 885 (Div. 2)"). The round will take place on [Sunday, July 16, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=7&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

This round is dedicated to an amazingly beautiful girl **Vika** that I love very much. Every problem will be about her and related to her life.

The round will be rated for participants with rating lower than 2100. We will be glad to see the participants with a higher rating to take part in our round unofficially as well!

You will be given **6** problems to solve in **2** hours.
