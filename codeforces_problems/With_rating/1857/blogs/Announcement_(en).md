Hello Codeforces!

We are pleased to invite you all to participate in [Codeforces Round 891 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1857), which will start on [Monday, August 7, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=7&month=8&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The format of the event will be like any Div. 3 rounds:

 * 6-8 tasks;
* ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission;
* 12-hour phase of **open hacks** after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points)
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated
* by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table.

We encourage participants with a rating of 1600+ not to create new accounts but to participate unofficially.

Only [trusted participants](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) of the third division will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participant* of the third division, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you.**

Problems have been created and written by our team: [FBI](https://codeforces.com/profile/FBI "Candidate Master FBI"), [Skillful_Wanderer](https://codeforces.com/profile/Skillful_Wanderer "Expert Skillful_Wanderer"), [SashaT9](https://codeforces.com/profile/SashaT9 "Expert SashaT9") and [Pa_sha](https://codeforces.com/profile/Pa_sha "Expert Pa_sha").

Good luck!

**UPD: There was an error on problem F. We fixed the tests and rejudged solutions . We apologize for that. It only affected a few people whose solutions passes all tests now. Also some hacks were already added to the tests and broke some of solutions.**
