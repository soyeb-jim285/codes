### GL & HF ;)

  [Sign up for the contest →](https://codeforces.com/contests/1864) This round wouldn't have been possible without Harbour.Space University's support.

This contest is **for all interested eligible programmers** who want to start their bachelor and master studies in Barcelona, Spain or Bangkok, Thailand, and join ICPC team.

For the next academic year (2023/24), Harbour.Space University is recruiting a fascinating community of competitive programmers from the top prize-winners of international Olympiads to [join one of several competitive programming teams at the university](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/news/articles/habour-space-great-performance-at-swerc-next-stop-icpc-world-finals).

In the next few years, their goal is to continue winning SWERC and competing at a high level in the ICPC globally. Therefore they want to invest a serious amount of energy, resources, and talent into these activities.

That’s why you are invited on an exciting journey in the company of like-minded people, outstanding coaches, and ongoing partnership Harbour.Space University with Codeforces.

Over 100 educational rounds were already organized, so the time has come to test our joint efforts and reward the most diligent.

**Here’s what you win if you place in the contest:**

As a guideline, it is in the range of 700-1500 EUR (it might be applied to the contestants who win 4th-10th places).
