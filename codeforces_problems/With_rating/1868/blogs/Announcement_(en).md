Hello, Codeforces! & Happy Chinese Teachers' Day!

We (OICon Team) are so excited to invite you to take part in OICon Round 1 ([Codeforces Round 896 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1868 "Codeforces Round 896 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 896 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1869 "Codeforces Round 896 (Div. 2)")) which will start on [Sunday, September 10, 2023 at 20:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=10&month=9&year=2023&hour=17&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). You will be given 6 problems and 2.5 hours to solve them in both divisions.

 * **Please notice the unusual starting time!**
* One of the problems has two versions but their statement are not exactly the same, which means that you **can't** pass the easy version using the code of the hard version. However, you can only make hacks when you pass both versions.
* There will be 0 interactive problem in each division so you needn't read the [guide for interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307).
* Score distribution:
	+ Div. 1: 500−(500+750)−1000−1750−2500−3000
	+ Div. 2: 500−750−1250−(1250+1500)−2500−3250

The problems were authored and prepared by [Error_Yuan](https://codeforces.com/profile/Error_Yuan "Candidate Master Error_Yuan"), [duck_pear](https://codeforces.com/profile/duck_pear "Master duck_pear"), [programpiggy](https://codeforces.com/profile/programpiggy "Expert programpiggy") and me.
