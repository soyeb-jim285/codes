Hello, Codeforces!

[ognjentesic](https://codeforces.com/profile/ognjentesic "Pupil ognjentesic"), [wxhtzdy](https://codeforces.com/profile/wxhtzdy "Master wxhtzdy"), [OAleksa](https://codeforces.com/profile/OAleksa "Specialist OAleksa"), [AndrewPav](https://codeforces.com/profile/AndrewPav "Specialist AndrewPav"), [Acanikolic73](https://codeforces.com/profile/Acanikolic73 "Specialist Acanikolic73") and I are glad to invite you to the [Codeforces Round 900 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1878 "Codeforces Round 900 (Div. 3)").

It starts on [Tuesday, September 26, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=26&month=9&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166)

You will be given **7 problems** and **2 hours and 15 minutes** to solve them.

Note that the **penalty** for the wrong submission in this round is **10 minutes**.

Also note that there will be a **12 hour open hacking phase** after the round.

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228), that only the *trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participant of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them)
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, the round will be rated for you.**
