<h1 style='text-align: center;'> C2. Doremy's Drying Plan (Hard Version)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 4 seconds</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 1024 megabytes</h5>

The only differences between the two versions of this problem are the constraint on $k$, the time limit and the memory limit. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Doremy lives in a rainy country consisting of $n$ cities numbered from $1$ to $n$.

The weather broadcast predicted the distribution of rain in the next $m$ days. In the $i$-th day, it will rain in the cities in the interval $[l_i, r_i]$. A city is called dry if it will never rain in that city in the next $m$ days.

It turns out that Doremy has a special power. She can choose $k$ days, and during these days it will not rain. Doremy wants to calculate the maximum number of dry cities after using the special power.

### Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$, $2 \le m \le 2\cdot 10^5$, $2 \le k \le \min(10, m)$) — the number of cities, the number of days, and the number of days of rain that Doremy can prevent.

Then, $m$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$, $r_i$ ($1\le l_i\le r_i\le n$) — the rain coverage on day $i$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

### Output

For each test case, output one integer — the maximum number of dry cities.

## Note

In the first test case, if Doremy prevents

* rain $1,2$, then city $2$ will be dry;
* rain $2,3$, then no city will be dry;
* rain $1,3$, then no city will be dry;

So there is at most $1$ dry city.

In the second test case, if Doremy prevents

* rain $1,2$, then city $1,2$ will be dry;
* rain $2,3$, then city $4,5$ will be dry;
* rain $1,3$, then city $1,5$ will be dry.

So there are at most $2$ dry cities.

In the third test case, it is optimal to prevent rain $1,2,4,5$.

In the forth test case, there is always a day of rain that wets all the cities and cannot be prevented.
