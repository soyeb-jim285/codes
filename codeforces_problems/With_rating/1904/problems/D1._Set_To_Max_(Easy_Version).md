<h1 style='text-align: center;'> D1. Set To Max (Easy Version)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 2 seconds</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

This is the easy version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions of this problem are the constraints on $n$ and the time limit. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

You are given two arrays $a$ and $b$ of length $n$.

You can perform the following operation some (possibly zero) times: 

1. choose $l$ and $r$ such that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$.
2. let $x=\max(a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r)$.
3. for all $l \leq i \leq r$, set $a_i := x$.

Determine if you can make array $a$ equal to array $b$.

### Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the length of the arrays.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) — the elements of array $a$.

The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \le b_i \le n$) — the elements of array $b$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.

### Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if you can make $a$ into $b$ using any number of operations, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

## Example

### Input


```text
551 2 3 2 41 3 3 2 453 4 2 2 43 4 3 4 453 2 1 1 13 3 3 2 221 11 231 1 22 1 2
```
### Output

```text

YES
NO
YES
NO
NO

```
## Note

In the first test case, we can achieve array $b$ by applying a single operation: $(l,r)=(2,3)$.

In the second test case, it can be shown we cannot achieve array $b$ in any amount of operations.

In the third test case, we can achieve array $b$ by applying two operations: $(l,r)=(2,5)$. followed by $(l,r)=(1,3)$.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, it can be shown we cannot achieve array $b$ in any amount of operations.
