Hello Codeforces!

We are going to hold The 2023 ICPC Asia Jakarta Regional Contest.

We invite you to join the online mirror contest [2023-2024 ICPC, Asia Jakarta Regional Contest (Online Mirror, Unrated, ICPC Rules, Teams Preferred)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1906) on Codeforces. It will be held on [Sunday, December 3, 2023 at 10:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=3&month=12&year=2023&hour=7&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) and will last for 5 hours.

The mirror will be held using ICPC-style scoring with 10 to 13 problems. The problem statements will only be available in English. We encourage participating as a team using only one computer for coding (as in ICPC contests). The mirror will be unrated.
