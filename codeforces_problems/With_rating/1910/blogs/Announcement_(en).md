We are thrilled to announce the **return of Kotlin Heroes**! As we resume this competition, we're eager both to welcome back some familiar names and meet new participants. Let's make Kotlin Heroes: Episode 9 an occasion to remember!

We would like to thank everyone who participated in the previous eight Kotlin Heroes competitions: [Episode 1](https://codeforces.com/contests/1170,1171), [Episode 2](https://codeforces.com/contests/1211,1212), [Episode 3](https://codeforces.com/contests/1297,1298), [Episode 4](https://codeforces.com/contests/1346,1347), [Episode 5: ICPC Round](https://codeforces.com/contests/1432,1431), [Episode 6](https://codeforces.com/contests/1488,1489), [Episode 7](https://codeforces.com/contests/1533,1532), and [Episode 8](https://codeforces.com/contests/1571,1570).

Kotlin Heroes is a great way to play around with Kotlin’s features, learn something new, and practice using the language by solving fun problems. It is great for programmers of any level! 

We invite you to join the [practice round](https://codeforces.com/contests/1911), where you can hone your algorithmic problem-solving skills and complete training problems. In this round, all the solutions are open and you can request hints if you’re stuck.

Here are some things you can do to help you refresh your knowledge of Kotlin and learn more about competitive programming while you practice:

 * Review our Kotlin solutions for the [Advent of Code algorithmic puzzles](https://codeforces.com/https://kotlinlang.org/docs/advent-of-code.html).
* Read our [competitive programming tutorial](https://codeforces.com/https://kotlinlang.org/docs/competitive-programming.html).
* Watch the videos from our [Kotlin in Competitive Programming](https://codeforces.com/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFc5cFwUnmyQA0l15nAfE1-pnu6fSvvG) YouTube playlist.
* Look at the problems from the [previous practice rounds](https://codeforces.com/contests/1489,1532,1570).

On **December 11, 2023**, the real challenge begins! [Kotlin Heroes: Episode 9](https://codeforces.com/contests/1910) will last **2 hours 30 minutes** and will feature a set of problems ranging from simple ones, which are designed to be solvable by anyone, to some really tricky ones for seasoned competitive programmers.
