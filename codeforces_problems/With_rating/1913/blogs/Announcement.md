Series of Educational Rounds continue being held as [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) initiative! You can read the details about the cooperation between [Harbour.Space University](https://codeforces.com/https://harbour.space/) and Codeforces in the [blog post](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/51208).

This round will be **rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100**. It will be held on extended ICPC rules.
