# Announcement

Hello, Codeforces!

On [Tuesday, December 19, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=12&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166) the [Codeforces Round 916 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1914 "Codeforces Round 916 (Div. 3)") will start. You will be offered 6-8 problems with expected difficulties to compose an interesting competition for participants with ratings up to 1600. However, all of you who wish to take part and have a rating of 1600 or higher, can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks.

You will be given **2 hours and 15 minutes** to solve **6-8 problems**. The penalty for a wrong submission is equal to **10 minutes**.

[We remind you](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only *the trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. As it is written on the blog which you can access by this link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as *a trusted participant of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

The problems were invented and prepared by Adilbek [adedalic](https://codeforces.com/profile/adedalic "International Master adedalic") Dalabaev, Ivan [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "International Grandmaster BledDest") Androsov, Maksim [Neon](https://codeforces.com/profile/Neon "Candidate Master Neon") Mescheryakov, Roman [Roms](https://codeforces.com/profile/Roms "Master Roms") Glazov, Alexander [fcspartakm](https://codeforces.com/profile/fcspartakm "Candidate Master fcspartakm") Frolov, and me. Also, big thanks to Vladislav [Vladosiya](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vladosiya "Expert Vladosiya") Vlasov for his excellent coordination.

Thanks to Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for Codeforces and Polygon systems!
