[mesanu](https://codeforces.com/profile/mesanu "Candidate Master mesanu"), [SlavicG](https://codeforces.com/profile/SlavicG "Master SlavicG") and I are very excited to invite you to [Codeforces Round 928 (Div. 4)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1926 "Codeforces Round 928 (Div. 4)")! It starts on [Monday, February 19, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=19&month=2&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). We would also like to give a very special thanks to the efforts of [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") and [Vladosiya](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vladosiya "Expert Vladosiya"), who helped significantly with the preparation of the round!

The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:

 * 5-8 tasks;
* ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission;
* 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points)
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated
* by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are an unrated participant/newcomer).

We urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism but to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest for the official participants.

Only *trusted participants of the fourth division* will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as *a trusted participant of the fourth division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1400 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the fourth division or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you.**

Thanks a lot to the testers: [MADE_IN_HEAVEN](https://codeforces.com/profile/MADE_IN_HEAVEN "Expert MADE_IN_HEAVEN"), [Gheal](https://codeforces.com/profile/Gheal "Master Gheal"), [Dominater069](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dominater069 "Grandmaster Dominater069"), [Phantom_Performer](https://codeforces.com/profile/Phantom_Performer "Master Phantom_Performer"), [Vladosiya](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vladosiya "Expert Vladosiya"), [htetgm](https://codeforces.com/profile/htetgm "Candidate Master htetgm"), [hbarp](https://codeforces.com/profile/hbarp "Candidate Master hbarp"), [tvladm](https://codeforces.com/profile/tvladm "Expert tvladm")!
