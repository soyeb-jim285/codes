Gamarjoba, Codeforces!

On [Tuesday, February 6, 2024 at 20:45UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=2&year=2024&hour=17&min=45&sec=0&p1=166) will start [Codeforces Round 923 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1927 "Codeforces Round 923 (Div. 3)"), the next Codeforces round for the Div.3.

Lately, I've been coming up with problem ideas less frequently, but I don't want to lose this skill. Welcome to the round where all problems are my own creation! I hope you'll enjoy them.

A huge thank you to [Vladosiya](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vladosiya "Эксперт Vladosiya") for preparing the majority of problems in Polygon. Also, thanks to [pashka](https://codeforces.com/profile/pashka "Международный гроссмейстер pashka") and [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Легендарный гроссмейстер KAN") for helping with the discussion of problem ideas.

Thank you very much [74TrAkToR](https://codeforces.com/profile/74TrAkToR "Мастер 74TrAkToR"), [CLown1331](https://codeforces.com/profile/CLown1331 "Специалист CLown1331"), [EternalAlexander](https://codeforces.com/profile/EternalAlexander "Международный гроссмейстер EternalAlexander"), [Jostic11](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jostic11 "Мастер Jostic11"), [Killever](https://codeforces.com/profile/Killever "Ученик Killever"), [KoT_OsKaR](https://codeforces.com/profile/KoT_OsKaR "Эксперт KoT_OsKaR"), [LoveWX](https://codeforces.com/profile/LoveWX "Специалист LoveWX"), [MADE_IN_HEAVEN](https://codeforces.com/profile/MADE_IN_HEAVEN "Эксперт MADE_IN_HEAVEN"), [dan_dolmatov](https://codeforces.com/profile/dan_dolmatov "Эксперт dan_dolmatov"), [jnmtz111__](https://codeforces.com/profile/jnmtz111__ "Ученик jnmtz111__"), [pedrolino](https://codeforces.com/profile/pedrolino "Эксперт pedrolino"), [theRealChainman](https://codeforces.com/profile/theRealChainman "Специалист theRealChainman"), [yorky](https://codeforces.com/profile/yorky "Мастер yorky") for testing the round.

As usual for the Div.3 rounds:

 * There will be 6-8 tasks in a round.
* The round duration is 2 hours and 15 minutes.
* The round follows the ICPC rules, with a penalty for an incorrect submission being 10 minutes.
* The round is rated for participants with ratings up to 1600.
* After the round, there will be a 12-hour open hacking phase.

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the trusted participants of the Div.3 will be included in the official standings table. As it is written in the link, this is a compulsory measure to combat unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the third division, you must:

 * Participate in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them).
* Not have a rating of 1900 or higher.

Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.

Good luck to all!

 *~~I really like it when the round announcement includes a photo of the authors. I plan to add one if I can take a suitable photo.~~*
