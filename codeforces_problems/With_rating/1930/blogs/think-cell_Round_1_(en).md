**UPD 2**: [Editorial](Tutorial_(en).md) is out.

**And now a word from our round partner – [think-cell](https://www.think-cell.com/codeforces):**

[![text](images/think-cell.svg)](https://www.think-cell.com/codeforces)

think-cell is the leading data visualization software for business presentations. Our mission is to offer the most intuitive user interface for generating complex data-driven charts and slides, while at the same time ensuring seamless integration with Microsoft Office. We work on challenging visualization problems, reverse-engineer Microsoft’s code, and reinvent how slides are created. think-cell is the only German company funding the C++ ISO committee delegation, so there is a good chance that components we invent will find their way into the standard.

Right now, **we are looking for smart, creative C++ engineers** with a solid theoretical background to join our engineering team.

**Highlights of the role:** 

 * We use the latest C++ features as soon as the compilers support them.
* We’re not afraid of advanced template metaprogramming or macros when they avoid code duplication or lead to cleaner, more readable code.
* We prefer algorithms and ranges (esp. [ours](https://codeforces.com/https://github.com/think-cell/think-cell-library)!) over raw loops.
* We take the time to deliver perfect code.
* We love refactoring and modernizing old code and introducing our own libraries.
* If we can do better than the standard library, we write our own!
* If we have done something cool, we talk about it at C++ conferences.
* If we are missing a C++ language feature, we write a proposal and present it to the C++ standard committee.

**Here is what we offer:** 

 * A competitive salary from the start and **a raise to EUR 130,000 annually** after only one year.
* **Full support with relocation to Berlin or the option to work fully remotely**.
* An apartment for the first month if relocating to Berlin.
* Lifestyle-friendly working hours, **no deadlines, no overtime**.
* **No scheduled meetings.**
* An international team of brilliant minds.
* A flat organisation with respectful colleagues and plenty of room for your ideas.
* A working environment that is driven by the strive for excellence.
