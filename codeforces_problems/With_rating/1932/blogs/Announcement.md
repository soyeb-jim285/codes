# Announcement

Hello! On [Sunday, February 18, 2024 at 18:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=2&year=2024&hour=15&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) will start [Codeforces Round 927 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1932 "Codeforces Round 927 (Div. 3)"), the next Codeforces round for the third division.

**The round is based on problems from [JetBrains Academy Youth Challenge](https://codeforces.com/https://lp.jetbrains.com/youth-challenge/). If you participated in it, please don't participate in this round.**

Problems for this round are prepared by [denk](https://codeforces.com/profile/denk "Expert denk"), [step_by_step](https://codeforces.com/profile/step_by_step "International Grandmaster step_by_step"), [goncharovmike](https://codeforces.com/profile/goncharovmike "Candidate Master goncharovmike"), [ikrpprppp](https://codeforces.com/profile/ikrpprppp "Master ikrpprppp"), [pashka](https://codeforces.com/profile/pashka "International Grandmaster pashka"), [Vladosiya](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vladosiya "Expert Vladosiya") and [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov").

Thank you very much [awoo](https://codeforces.com/profile/awoo "International Master awoo"), [BledDest](https://codeforces.com/profile/BledDest "International Grandmaster BledDest"), [buyolitsez](https://codeforces.com/profile/buyolitsez "Master buyolitsez"), [EgorUlin](https://codeforces.com/profile/EgorUlin "Candidate Master EgorUlin"), [Gojova](https://codeforces.com/profile/Gojova "Specialist Gojova"), [GrandFruit](https://codeforces.com/profile/GrandFruit "Expert GrandFruit"), [Hello_zoka](https://codeforces.com/profile/Hello_zoka "Master Hello_zoka"), [petyb](https://codeforces.com/profile/petyb "Candidate Master petyb"), [scanhex](https://codeforces.com/profile/scanhex "Grandmaster scanhex"), [senjougaharin](https://codeforces.com/profile/senjougaharin "Master senjougaharin"), [shnirelman](https://codeforces.com/profile/shnirelman "International Grandmaster shnirelman"), [SomethingNew](https://codeforces.com/profile/SomethingNew "International Grandmaster SomethingNew"), [Toy_mouse](https://codeforces.com/profile/Toy_mouse "Pupil Toy_mouse"), [Zandler](https://codeforces.com/profile/Zandler "Specialist Zandler") for testing the round.

As usual for the third division rounds:

 * there will be 6-8 tasks in a round
* round duration is 2 hours 15 minutes
* the round follows the ICPC rules, penalty for an incorrect submission is 10 minutes
* round is rated for participants with ratings up to 1600
* after the round there will be a 12-hour open hacking phase

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behaviour. To qualify as a trusted participant of the third division, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them)
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

Good luck to all!
