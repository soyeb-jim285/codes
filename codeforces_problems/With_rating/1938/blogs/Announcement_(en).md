Hi,

We would like to invite you to participate in the [live online mirror contest of The 2024 ICPC Asia Pacific Championship](https://codeforces.com/contests/1938) next weekend. ICPC Asia Pacific Championship is a new playoff round introduced to the Asia Pacific region this year. It is the contest for top non-winning teams from all regional contests in the region to qualify to the World Finals. See the [region rules](https://codeforces.com/https://icpc.iisf.or.jp/asia-pacific/top/2023-24-cycle/) and [competition page](https://codeforces.com/https://icpc.asia/) for more details.

The official contest is scheduled to start at [Saturday, 2 March 2024, 9am (UTC+7)](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=The+2024+ICPC+Asia+Pacific+Championship&iso=20240302T09&p1=95&ah=5). The live online mirror contest is scheduled to start [**only 5 minutes later**](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=The+2024+ICPC+Asia+Pacific+Championship+-+Online+Mirror&iso=20240302T0905&p1=95&ah=5), to keep both contests run almost in sync. The contest is 5 hours long and consists of several problems.

Please note that we might have to postpone the live online mirror contest in case the official contest is delayed. This is to the ensure that the tasks are not available to the public until the official contest starts. The official contest will be livestreamed [here](https://codeforces.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBKslJwv6yM) and the scoreboard can be accessed [here](https://codeforces.com/https://icpcasia.firebaseapp.com/).

The contest will use ICPC-style scoring (same as the official contest) and will be unrated. You can participate as an individual or as a team, although as a team of three members is preferred.

See you on top of the leaderboard.

**UPD1:** The official contest is postponed by (at least) 30 minutes, so the mirror contest is postponed similarly.

**UPD2:** The official contest is postponed by 20 minutes (instead of the originally announced 30 minutes) after its original schedule, but the mirror contest is still scheduled to start 30 minutes after its original schedule to avoid more confusion.

**UPD3:** The analysis is available [here](https://codeforces.com/https://icpc.asia/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/task-analysis.pdf)
