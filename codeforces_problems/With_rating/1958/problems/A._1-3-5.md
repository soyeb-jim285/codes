In Berland, coins of worth $1$, $3$ and $5$ burles are commonly used (burles are local currency).

Eva has to pay exactly $n$ burles in a shop. She has an infinite amount of coins of all three types. However, she doesn't like to pay using coins worth $1$ burle — she thinks they are the most convenient to use.

Help Eva to calculate the minimum number of coins worth $1$ burle she has to use, if she has to pay exactly $n$ burles. 
## Note

 that she can spend any number of coins worth $3$ and/or $5$ burles.

### Input

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line, containing one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$).

### Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of $1$-burle coins Eva has to use.

## Example

### Input


```text
57842211
```
### Output

```text

1
0
0
2
0

```
## Note

In the first test case, Eva should use $1$ coin worth $1$ burle, and $2$ coins worth $3$ burles.

In the second test case, Eva should use $1$ coin worth $3$ burles and $1$ coin worth $5$ burles.

In the third test case, Eva should use $14$ coins worth $3$ burles.

In the fourth test case, Eva should use $2$ coins worth $1$ burle.

In the fifth test case, Eva should use $2$ coins worth $3$ burles and $1$ coin worth $5$ burles.
