Hi, Codeforces!

I welcome everyone to participate in [Codeforces Round 941 (Div. 1)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1965 "Codeforces Round 941 (Div. 1)") and [Codeforces Round 941 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1966 "Codeforces Round 941 (Div. 2)"), which will start on [Saturday, April 27, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=27&month=4&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

Both divisions will be given 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them.

**One of the problems was also used in the Yandex Cup finals**, which was authored by [tourist](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist "Legendary Grandmaster tourist"), so if you participated in the Yandex Cup finals or know the problems, please refrain from participating. All other problems were created and prepared by me.

I would like to thank:
