Hello everyone,

[FBI](https://codeforces.com/profile/FBI "Expert FBI") and [SashaT9](https://codeforces.com/profile/SashaT9 "Expert SashaT9") are very exited to invite you to [Codeforces Round 943 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1968 "Codeforces Round 943 (Div. 3)")! It starts on [Thursday, May 2, 2024 at 20:45UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=2&month=5&year=2024&hour=17&min=45&sec=0&p1=166).

The format of the event will be like any Div. 3 rounds:

 * 6-8 tasks;
* ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission;
* 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points);
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests.

Only [trusted participants](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) of the third division will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the third division, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you.**

We would like to thank:
