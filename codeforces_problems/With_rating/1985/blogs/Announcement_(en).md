Hellowo Codeforcers :3
----------------------

[sum](https://codeforces.com/profile/sum "Master sum") and I are very delighted, ecstatic, enchanted, euphoric, excited, exultant, jubilant, overjoyed, and proud to invite you to participate in [Codeforces Round 952 (Div. 4)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985 "Codeforces Round 952 (Div. 4)"), which will start on [Tuesday, June 11, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=11&month=6&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). There will be 88 problems, with one split into two subtasks, to be solved in 2.52.5 hours.

As usual, I have to copy and paste the following...

The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:

 * 5-8 tasks;
* ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission;
* 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points)
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated
* by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are an unrated participant/newcomer).

We urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism but to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest for the official participants.

Only *trusted participants of the fourth division* will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as *a trusted participant of the fourth division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1400 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the fourth division or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you.**

We want to express overwhelming gratitude to the following individuals for making the contest possible:
