# Announcement

Hello, Codeforces! We are pleased to invite you to [Codeforces Round 957 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1992 "Codeforces Round 957 (Div. 3)"), which will be held on [Thursday, July 11, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=11&month=7&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). 

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). You will be offered 7 problems, which I with [Noobish_Monk](https://codeforces.com/profile/Noobish_Monk "Master Noobish_Monk"), [ErnKor](https://codeforces.com/profile/ErnKor "Expert ErnKor"), [Kmes](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kmes "Expert Kmes") and [ArSarapkin](https://codeforces.com/profile/ArSarapkin "International Master ArSarapkin") have prepared for you.

The rules of the third division are:

 * The **penalty** for a wrong submission is **10 minutes**.
* 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points)
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated.

[Reminding you](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228), that *only trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participant of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you**.
