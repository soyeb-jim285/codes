# Announcement

Hi!

Tomorrow, on [March 24-th, 2018 at 15:35 UTC](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=VK+Cup+2018+Round+2&iso=20180324T1835&p1=352&ah=2) we will host the second round of VK Cup 2018 — a programming tournament for Russian-speaking youth. 450 teams that were the best in the first round and the first wild-card round will compete tomorrow. The top 100 teams will advance to the third round directly and get a tournament t-shirt, while the others will have one more chance in the second wild-card round.

For English-speaking community as well as for those who haven't advanced to the second round or haven't participated in VK Cup 2018, we will host parallel Codeforces round for both divisions, as usual. Feel free to take part!

**Please note that the tournament is for Russian-speaking people. If you don't speak Russian, you must not compete in the VK Cup round, register for the parallel round instead. Otherwise it is considered as a flagrant violation of rules and might be subject to disqualification and Codeforces ban. Please respect the organizers.**

VK Cup 2018 Round 2 and the round for the first division will have six problems each, the second division round will have five of them.
