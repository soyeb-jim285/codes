The 6th April Fools Day Contest will take place on Sunday [April 1st](https://codeforces.com/http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=4&year=2018&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This is a joke competition in which solving the problem is often easier than figuring out what the actual task is.

This year I tried to make the problems less puzzling and more versatile. For example, almost all problems have a statement! And you won't need OEIS this time :-)

In this round you'll be given 7 weird problems and 2 hours to solve them. The contest will use ACM ICPC rules (no hacks, the standings are decided by the number of solved problems and penalty time earned on them), and it will be unrated. You can submit solutions in any language allowed by Codeforces. To get an idea of what the contest will look like, you can check out the contests of the past years: [2012](//codeforces.com/contest/171), [2013](//codeforces.com/contest/290), [2014](//codeforces.com/contest/409), [2016](//codeforces.com/contest/656), [2017](//codeforces.com/contest/784).

As usual, to enjoy competing in this round you'll need a sense of humor compatible with mine! Good luck, and have fun!
