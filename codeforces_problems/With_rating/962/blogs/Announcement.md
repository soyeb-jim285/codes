From the ever present in ACM World Finals city of Moscow, to the new-comer on the world stage city of Kollam — Hello India x Russia Programming Bootcamp showcased heart, passion, and a universal drive towards a better competition.

“It's the first time I participate at Hello ACM-ICPC Bootcamp in Asia and I admire local hospitality and students motivation. Everyone seems to be eager to learn, participants stay very late upsolving the contest problems and revising the topics they were thought during the day” states Gleb [GlebsHP](https://codeforces.com/profile/GlebsHP "International Grandmaster GlebsHP") Evstropov, The Coordinator of the Programming Committee.

The latest in world finals simulation training would not be possible without the bronze sponsorship of [VTB](https://codeforces.com/https://www.vtb.com), the institute with the most extensive international network of any Russian bank, boasting more than 30 banks and financial companies in more than 20 countries.
