Hello!

[Codeforces Round 481 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/978 "Codeforces Round 481 (Div. 3)") will start on [Sunday, May 13, 2018 at 15:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=13&month=5&year=2018&hour=12&min=5&sec=0&p1=166). It will be the second Div.3 round in the history of Codeforces. You will be offered 7 problems with expected difficulties to compose an interesting competition for participants with ratings up to 1600. Probably, participants from the first division will not be at all interested by this problems. And for 1600-1899 the problems will be too easy. However, all of you who wish to take part and have rating 1600 or higher, can register for the round unofficially.

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks.

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the *trusted participants of the third division* will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participants of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a *trusted participant of the third division* or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

The problem are written by me and [fcspartakm](https://codeforces.com/profile/fcspartakm "Candidate Master fcspartakm"). Many thanks to testers [AGrigorii](https://codeforces.com/profile/AGrigorii "Candidate Master AGrigorii"), [BigBag](https://codeforces.com/profile/BigBag "Grandmaster BigBag"), [nhho](https://codeforces.com/profile/nhho "Grandmaster nhho") and [Sert](https://codeforces.com/profile/Sert "Grandmaster Sert")!
