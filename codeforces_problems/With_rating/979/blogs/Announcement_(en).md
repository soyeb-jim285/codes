Hi Codeforces!

*Sorry for being late for the announcement.*

I'm glad to introduce to you my first contest [Codeforces Round 482 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/979 "Codeforces Round 482 (Div. 2)"). It will take place on [Monday, May 14, 2018 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=14&month=5&year=2018&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

You will have **5 problems** and **2 hours** to solve them.

The problems were prepared by me (Quyen Dinh), [Kuroni](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kuroni "Кандидат в мастера Kuroni") (Trung Dang) and [Shirone](https://codeforces.com/profile/Shirone "Специалист Shirone") (Lam Le) with suggestions from [FallingStar](https://codeforces.com/profile/FallingStar "Мастер FallingStar") (Nhat Hoang) and [HaiDang2001VN](https://codeforces.com/profile/HaiDang2001VN "Специалист HaiDang2001VN") (Dang Huynh). I would like to thank [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Гроссмейстер KAN") for his great help in checking the problems and giving comments, [Tommyr7](https://codeforces.com/profile/Tommyr7 "Международный мастер Tommyr7") for testing all the problems and [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Штаб, MikeMirzayanov") for the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platform.

Note that the round is rated for everyone with rating below **2100**.

In this contest, you will meet *Kuro*, *Shiro* and *Katie*, the three naughty but smart cats who love asking thought-provoking questions. I hope you will find our problems interesting. Good luck to you all!
