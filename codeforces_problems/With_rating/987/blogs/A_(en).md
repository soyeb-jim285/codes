Hello!

I'm glad to invite you all to Round 485 which will take place on [Tuesday, May 29 at 18:35 UTC+3](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Codeforces+Round+%23485&iso=20180529T1835&p1=166&ah=2).

There will be 6 problems in each division, 3 of them are shared between divisions. 2 of div.2 problems created by [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN"), 7 others created by me. The contest duration is 2 hours. My problems were originally used in HSE Championship.

I would like to thank [Merkurev](https://codeforces.com/profile/Merkurev "International Grandmaster Merkurev") and [GlebsHP](https://codeforces.com/profile/GlebsHP "International Grandmaster GlebsHP") with whom I discussed the problems, [I_love_Tanya_Romanova](https://codeforces.com/profile/I_love_Tanya_Romanova "International Grandmaster I_love_Tanya_Romanova") for testing, [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") for round coordination and Codeforces and Polygon team for these beautiful platforms. I would also like to thank HSE for organizing the event. Oh, and [kb.](https://codeforces.com/profile/kb. "International Master kb.") for writing great legend for one of the problems (he will be surprised).

For those who for some reason like to know score distribution in advance:  
div.2: 500 — 1000 — 1250 — 1750 — 2250 — 3000  
div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1750 — 2500 — 2750 — 3000  
But I didn't properly discuss it with [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") so this is subject to change :)  
UPD: Discussed with [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN"), scores for C and D in div.2 increased by 250.

Good fun, have problems, read all the luck. As usual.

Oh, and if there will be no bad things, round will be rated. I hope.

I'm very sorry for issues with queue. I understand that it could ruin the contest for many of you. But please be understanding. Bad things happen. It could be some network problems or some electricity problems. [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov"), [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") and other people behind Codeforces trying their best to provide good service. But sometimes it's very hard for some reasons. I hope that you enjoyed the problems despite all the bad things.

We decided that round will be **rated**.

Editorial will be posted tomorrow.
