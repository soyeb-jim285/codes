Here and there, summer's in the air! (I beg your forgiveness, residents of the Southern Hemisphere... > <)

I'm delighted to invite you to [Codeforces Round 487 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/989 "Codeforces Round 487 (Div. 2)"), which starts at [Monday, June 11, 2018 at 19:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=11&month=6&year=2018&hour=16&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). Please note that the timing is, as usual, unusual.

This is my third time creating a contest from scratch. Along the way can be seen the efforts of: [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") the super-ultra-hyper-mega-meta coordinator, who has reviewed, refined and translated the problems; [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq"), [Livace](https://codeforces.com/profile/Livace "Master Livace"), [mike_live](https://codeforces.com/profile/mike_live "Candidate Master mike_live"), [Noam527](https://codeforces.com/profile/Noam527 "Master Noam527"), [RobeZH](https://codeforces.com/profile/RobeZH "Candidate Master RobeZH"), and [Tommyr7](https://codeforces.com/profile/Tommyr7 "International Master Tommyr7") the super-ultra-great-delicious-wonderful testers, that have populated our collection of solutions; and [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") along with the super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing Codeforces/Polygon team, who have made all these happen in the way it is! Kudos to all of you!

The round will be **rated** for contestants from the second division, and the first division are welcomed as out-of-competition participants. There will be five problems to work on for two hours. The scoring distribution will be announced later, because of... love.

Despite my illiteracy, I included the stories in the hope that they'll be inspiring to some; feel free to skip them, if you'd like to fully concentrate on problems themselves.

We wish everyone a fun experience and a fair rating. We'll be pleased to have you on the contest!

*Gone are the freshness and beauty of springtide, which raises the downheartedness in Mino the poet, as in many other poets. Mino's best friend, Kanno the painter, however, is intrigued by the changing palettes brought about by the seasons. On this day, their journey in search of spring begins...*

**UPD 1** The scoring is standard: **500–1000–1500–2000–2500**. It's however strongly recommended to read other problems if you're stuck, since you may not necessarily find later problems harder. Good luck!

**UPD 2** Congratulations to top contestants! Also big kudos to all participants!
