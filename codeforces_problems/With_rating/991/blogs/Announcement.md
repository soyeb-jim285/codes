# Announcement

Hello!

Codeforces Round #491 (Div.2) will start this Saturday, [June 23, 18:35 (UTC+3)](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=23&month=6&year=2018&hour=18&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This round will be **rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100** and other contestants can join it out of competition.

This round problems have a significant intersection with NNSU Programming Contest 2018. Please **do not participate** in the round if you participated in the NNSU contest or tried to upsolve the problems.

During the round you have to help student Vasya to manage the difficulties caused by the end of the academic year. There will be 6 problems and 2 hours to solve them. If you solve all the problems in 25 minutes you will be able to watch the second half of South Korea — Mexico at the FIFA World Cup.

The scoring is unusual a bit: **500-1000-1250-1500-2000-2750**
