# Announcement

Hi, Codeforces! I'm glad to invite everybody to the #489 Codeforces Round, which will be held as soon as tomorrow, on [Monday, June 18, 2018 at 19:35](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&month=6&year=2018&hour=19&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be rated for all participants from the second division (with rating **below than 2100**). As usually, we will be glad to see participants from the first division out of competition!

Problems for the round have been invented and prepared by us, pupils of Moscow school №2007, Dmitry [gop2024](https://codeforces.com/profile/gop2024 "Master gop2024") Grigorev and Fedor [----------](https://codeforces.com/profile/---------- "Master ----------") Ushakov. We want to give thanks to Andrew [GreenGrape](https://codeforces.com/profile/GreenGrape "Candidate Master GreenGrape") Raiskiy for his aid in preparing and testing of the problems, to Ildar [300iq](https://codeforces.com/profile/300iq "International Grandmaster 300iq") Gainullin and to AmirReza [Arpa](https://codeforces.com/profile/Arpa "Master Arpa") PoorAkhavan who have tested our problems too and to the coordinator Nikolay [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") Kalinin, since our sometimes strange and undeveloped ideas have become eventually the Codeforces round. Also, we say thank you to Mike [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov") Mirzayanov for his unbelievable Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

You will receive 5 problems and 2 hours for solving it. During the round you will be helping for an extraordinary girl Nastya, who has been living in Byteland and sometimes receives very strange gifts for her birthday :). 

Score distribution will be announced, traditionally, closer to the start of the contest.

We're holding our the first and, I hope, not the last round in Codeforces, so I hope a lot you will like our problems. Please, read all the problems. Anyway, I wish luck and high rating for all the participants!

I'm looking forward your participation.

**UPD** Score distribution is standart — **500-1000-1500-2000-2500**

**UPD2** Thank you for your participation in the contest! It's very-very pleasant for me if you like the problems, and I'm sorry if you don't :) I hope the next my contest will be even better, than this. Thank you for all!
