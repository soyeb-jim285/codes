# Announcement

**UPD** note that the score distribution has changed

**UPD2:** [LHiC](https://codeforces.com/profile/LHiC "Legendary Grandmaster LHiC") found a bug in the author solution of div1-F. We are working on the situation.

**UPD3:** we found a correct solution for div1-F and both submissions made during the contest pass all the tests against the correct solution. The round remains rated.

Hi, everybody,

Codeforces round 488 for both divisions will take place on [Saturday, June 16, 2018 at 22:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=16&month=6&year=2018&hour=19&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). The round will be 2.5 hours long (which is 30 minutes longer than usual).

The contest is created by [NEAR](https://codeforces.com/http://near.ai/blog) and its friends. NEAR is working on teaching machines to compete in programming competitions. Read [our blog post](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/59746) to learn more about the state of the art in the program synthesis today, our vision, and how you can help us bring this vision to reality.

The contest will feature 6 problems for each division, with 4 problems shared across them.

The problems for the contest are from the test rounds hosted on a system JavaBlitz last year. If you participated in any of the JavaBlitz rounds, you shall not participate in this round.

The score distribution in the first division is 500-1000-1000-1500-2250-3000

In the second -- 500-1000-1500-2000-2000-2500

The round is rated for both divisions.

All problems are initially created by myself, Alexander "[AlexSkidanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlexSkidanov "International Master AlexSkidanov")" Skidanov, and by Nikita "[FalseMirror](https://codeforces.com/profile/FalseMirror "Candidate Master FalseMirror")" Bosov. David "[pieguy](https://codeforces.com/profile/pieguy "International Master pieguy")" Stolp, Alexander "[AlexFetisov](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlexFetisov "Master AlexFetisov")" Fetisko, Marcelo "[mnaeraxr](https://codeforces.com/profile/mnaeraxr "Grandmaster mnaeraxr")" Fornet, Nikolay "[KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN")" Kalinin and Mikhail "[cerealguy](https://codeforces.com/profile/cerealguy "Grandmaster cerealguy")" Kever helped tremendously ensuring the high quality of the problems.

As a closing note, we are constantly looking for people to help us label competitive programming data for research. Read more [here](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/59802).

Congratulations to winners!
