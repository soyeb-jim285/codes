# Announcement_(en)

Hello denizens of Codeforces once again!

After our last [two](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/21860) [rounds](//codeforces.com/blog/entry/43848), Yang Liu ([desert97](https://codeforces.com/profile/desert97 "Grandmaster desert97")) and I ([ksun48](https://codeforces.com/profile/ksun48 "Grandmaster ksun48")) are pleased to announce Codeforces Round #492, which will happen on [June 24, 2018 at 19:35 MSK](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=24&month=6&year=2018&hour=19&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). There will be two versions of the contest, one for users in Division 1 and one for users in Division 2. Both versions will have six problems, with four problems shared between the versions.

The round will feature our friend and superstar member of ACM-ICPC team MIT TWO, Allen Liu ([cliu568](https://codeforces.com/profile/cliu568 "Candidate Master cliu568")).

The scoring distribution will be visible once the contest begins. As usual, we'd like to thank our wonderful problem coordinator [KAN](https://codeforces.com/profile/KAN "Grandmaster KAN") and Codeforces administrator [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov "Headquarters, MikeMirzayanov"), as well as the rest of the Codeforces staff for keeping this site an amazing place for competitive programming. Thanks also to our testy testers [winger](https://codeforces.com/profile/winger "International Grandmaster winger"), [AlexFetisov](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlexFetisov "Master AlexFetisov"), and [demon1999](https://codeforces.com/profile/demon1999 "International Grandmaster demon1999").

This round is in honor of uDebug who have supported Codeforces on its anniversary. Thank you, uDebug! uDebug is an enthusiastic community of competitive programmers who help each other out by answering questions on chat, providing hints and solutions to problems from several online judges, furnishing test input and sharing feedback. On uDebug, you can select a problem you’ve coded up a solution for, provide input, and get the "accepted" output. You can visit it by [the link](https://codeforces.com/https://udebug.com/).

Good luck! As always, we encourage competitors to read all the problems.
