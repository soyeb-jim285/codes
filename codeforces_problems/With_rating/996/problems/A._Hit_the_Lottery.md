Allen has a LOT of money. He has $n$ dollars in the bank. For security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not disclose the reasons here). The denominations for dollar bills are $1$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $100$. What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?

##### Input

## Note

In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a $100$ dollar bill, a $20$ dollar bill, and a $5$ dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive $125$ dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two $20$ dollar bills and three $1$ dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw $100000000$ (ten million!) $100$ dollar bills.
