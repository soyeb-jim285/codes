Hi all!

The main phase of VRt Contest 2019 has ended. In the preliminary standings, five contestants managed to obtain a score of more than 60,000 points. The fight continued to the last day. Who will emerge as the winner after the final testing? We will know after it ends. (Update: [results](Discussion.md?#comment-511810) in a separate comment.)

I invite the contestants to share their solution ideas in the comments below, or in separate posts if their writeup is too large for a comment.
