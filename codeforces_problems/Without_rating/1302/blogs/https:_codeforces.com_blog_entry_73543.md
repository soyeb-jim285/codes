Hello!

Traditionally AIM Tech organizes a big party for Petrozavodsk camp participants to have fun and get an opportunity to communicate with each other. Usually it comes along with **a funny contest in unusual format**. This year we decided to share the fun with all codeforces community! 

This year we came up with a format requiring (probably) less time for preparing the contest. It is somewhat similar to an ordinary contest with a 3-hour duration. We already have some problem ideas, so it should be super easy to prepare the problems just one night before the competition. We hope everything will run smoothly!

The contest will start on [Monday, February 3, 2020 at 22:15UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=3&month=2&year=2020&hour=19&min=15&sec=0&p1=166). It could be a bit rescheduled due to onsite delays.

It will be **an unrated funny competition**. Unlike usual ICPC-style contests, you'll be given an archive with several open test cases and answers for each problem. You'll have some sample test cases in the statement too, they'll be included in the archive. However, the solutions will be tested against both open and hidden tests. **The open tests will be published as an encrypted zip-archive** in this post. **The password will be published just before the start of the contest**.

The statements will be **in English only** because we are running out of time in preparation and have to prioritize things.

It's not 100-percent clear at the moment, but it seems the contest will be somewhat hard, so **we recommend it for div. 1 participants**. However, div. 2 participants are welcome as always, but we can't guarantee the contest will be a perfect match for them.

It's possible **to participate both individually and in teams of maximum 3 persons**.

Another point to mention is that the order of problems could be not the same as the order of their difficulties. But we'll try to do so. A bit.

The authors to blame are [Kostroma](https://codeforces.com/profile/Kostroma "International Grandmaster Kostroma"), [zemen](https://codeforces.com/profile/zemen "International Grandmaster zemen"), [Golovanov399](https://codeforces.com/profile/Golovanov399 "International Grandmaster Golovanov399"), [mathbunnyru](https://codeforces.com/profile/mathbunnyru "Candidate Master mathbunnyru") and [ArtDitel](https://codeforces.com/profile/ArtDitel "Candidate Master ArtDitel").

As you may notice, it is just one night before the competition, so we should start preparing the problems. We hope that we'll manage not to do very stupid bugs in the tests. See you at the competition!

**UPD** It's still more than 4 hours before the contest, but the open tests are already prepared! **You can download the archive using one of the two links:** [one](https://codeforces.com/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MGKbsAcMPfKn90RWq2yz3NtQQCHkxuGU/view) [two](https://codeforces.com/https://yadi.sk/d/cKcNviCaNkDRlQ). The encrypted archive contains another archive containing the actual tests.

**The password will be published here shortly before the start of the contest.**

**UPD2** We have to move contest 10 minutes forward, because we need to prepare the last problem :(

**UPD3** Oops, the contest is about to start, but we still don't have correct solutions! Unfortunately, each authors' solution contains a bug (or even several bugs!). However, we decided not to cancel the competition. We give you the outputs of the model solutions on open tests in the archive. Guess all the bugs in our solutions and get OK for the code with exactly same bugs! Good luck and have fun!

The password to the archive will be published as a clarification in the contest interface.

**UPD4** The password to the archive is oops_seems_that_nobody_tested_the_solutions

**UPD5** The [editorial](//codeforces.comTutorial_(en).md) is published, but it still does contain bugs, wait a bit while it is being debugged.

**UPD6** Feel free to share your opinion in the comments! Were the solutions enough buggy? Was it enough hard, or we should've added a couple of hard problems? Do you want to solve such contests in future?
