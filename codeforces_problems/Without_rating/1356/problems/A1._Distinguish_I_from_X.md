You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the identity (I gate) or the X gate. The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the I gate or 1 if it was the X gate. 

You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants exactly once.

You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:


```text
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;  
  
    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {  
        // your code here  
    }  
}
```
