<h1 style='text-align: center;'> A5. Distinguish Rz(θ) from Ry(θ)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 1 second</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

You are given an angle $\theta$ (in radians, $0.01\pi \le \theta \le 0.99 \pi$) and an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the $Rz(\theta)$ gate or the $Ry(\theta)$ gate. The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the $Rz(\theta)$ gate or 1 if it was the $Ry(\theta)$ gate. 

You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants as many times as you need (within the time limit).

You have to implement an operation which takes a floating-point number and a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:


```text
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;  
  
    operation Solve (theta : Double, unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {  
        // your code here  
    }  
}
```
