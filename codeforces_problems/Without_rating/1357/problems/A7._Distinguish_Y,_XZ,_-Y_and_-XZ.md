<h1 style='text-align: center;'> A7. Distinguish Y, XZ, -Y and -XZ</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 1 second</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the Y gate (possibly with an extra global phase of $-1$) or the sequence of Pauli Z and Pauli X gates (the Z gate applied first and the X gate applied second; possibly with an extra global phase of $-1$). The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return

* 0 if it was the Y gate,
* 1 if it was the $-$XZ gate,
* 2 if it was the $-$Y gate,
* 3 if it was the XZ gate.

You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants at most three times.

You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:


```text
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;  
  
    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {  
        // your code here  
    }  
}
```
