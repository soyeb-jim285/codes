With [Nickolas](https://codeforces.com/profile/Nickolas "Expert Nickolas") not writing a contest this year, [magnus.hegdahl](https://codeforces.com/profile/magnus.hegdahl "Candidate Master magnus.hegdahl") and I have decided to take up this sacred duty :). We would like to invite everyone on Codeforces to the [April Fools Day Contest 2022](https://codeforces.com/contest/1663 "April Fools Day Contest 2022"). Special thanks to [BucketPotato](https://codeforces.com/profile/BucketPotato "International Master BucketPotato") for volunteering to test this contest!

The 10th April Fools Day Contest will take place on [Friday, April 1, 2022 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=4&year=2022&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This is a joke competition in which solving the problem is often easier than figuring out what the actual task is.

In this round you'll be given several weird problems and 2 hours to solve them. The contest will use ACM ICPC rules (no hacks, the standings are decided by the number of solved problems and penalty time earned on them), and it will be unrated. You can submit solutions in any language allowed by Codeforces, unless the problem says otherwise. To get an idea of what the contest will look like, you can check out the contests of the past years: [2012](https://codeforces.com/contest/171), [2013](https://codeforces.com/contest/290), [2014](https://codeforces.com/contest/409), [2016](https://codeforces.com/contest/656), [2017](https://codeforces.com/contest/784), [2018](https://codeforces.com/contest/952), [2019](https://codeforces.com/contest/1145), [2020](https://codeforces.com/contest/1331), [2021](https://codeforces.com/contest/1505).

Good luck, and have fun!

**UPD:** There will be **8** problems. There will be only be an [interactive problem](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) if the Collatz Conjecture is true...

**UPD:** Thanks to everyone who participated! I hoped you enjoyed thinking over the problemset. The **[editorial is available](Tutorial_(en).md)**, complete with solution code and hints. Special congratulations to the winners.
