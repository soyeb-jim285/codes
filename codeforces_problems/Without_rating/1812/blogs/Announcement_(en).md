# Announcement_(en)

Hello, Codeforces!

I, along with [AlperenT](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlperenT "Master AlperenT"), [Ari](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ari "Grandmaster Ari"), [BucketPotato](https://codeforces.com/profile/BucketPotato "Grandmaster BucketPotato"), [ScarletS](https://codeforces.com/profile/ScarletS "Master ScarletS"), and [ToxicPie9](https://codeforces.com/profile/ToxicPie9 "Candidate Master ToxicPie9"), would like to invite everyone on Codeforces to the [April Fools Day Contest 2023](https://codeforces.com/contest/1812 "April Fools Day Contest 2023")! The 11th April Fools Day Contest will take place on [Saturday, April 1, 2023 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=4&year=2023&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This is a joke competition in which solving the problem is often easier than figuring out what the actual task is.

Please note that the round is **unrated**.

In this round you'll be given nn weird problems and 2 hours to solve them, where 7≤n≤127≤n≤12. At most √nn−−√ of the problems will be [interactive](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307). The contest will use ACM ICPC rules (no hacks, the standings are decided by the number of solved problems and penalty time earned on them).

You can submit solutions in any language allowed by Codeforces, unless the problem says otherwise. To get an idea of what the contest will look like, you can check out the contests of the past years: [2012](https://codeforces.com/contest/171), [2013](https://codeforces.com/contest/290), [2014](https://codeforces.com/contest/409), [2016](https://codeforces.com/contest/656), [2017](https://codeforces.com/contest/784), [2018](https://codeforces.com/contest/952), [2019](https://codeforces.com/contest/1145), [2020](https://codeforces.com/contest/1331), [2021](https://codeforces.com/contest/1505), [2022](https://codeforces.com/contest/1663).

Good luck, and have fun!
