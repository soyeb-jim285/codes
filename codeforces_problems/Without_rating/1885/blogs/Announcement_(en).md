#### Problem

We are glad to propose to you an exciting challenge **“Deterministic Scheduling for Extended Reality over 5G and Beyond”**, which is prepared by Huawei Wireless Product Line.

In this contest, we focus on a XR-service scheduling problem to maximize the total number of successfully transformed XR-data frames under specific transmission requirements. Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term for different types of realities such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), which can provide people with immersive experience. To achieve better user-experience, scheduling algorithm should be proposed to efficiently utilize the limited radio resources, e.g., time resource, frequency resource, and power resource. Due to several practical constraints, the scheduling task is a typical NP-hard problem.
