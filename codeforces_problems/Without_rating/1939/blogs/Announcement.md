# Announcement

Hi everybody,

In a few days there will be a Moscow Open Olympiad. This olympiad is prepared by Moscow Olympiad Scientific Committee that you may know by Moscow Olympiad in Programming, Moscow Team Olympiad, and Megapolis Olympiad (rounds [327](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/21185), [342](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/23309), [345](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43615), [376](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/47769), [401](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/50613), [433](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/54350), [441](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55201), [466](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57981), [469](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/58229), [507](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/61638), [516](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62440), [541](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65433), [545](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/65768), [567](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/67703), [583](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/69538), [594](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/70680), [622](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/74106), [626](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/52457), [657](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/80214), [680](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/84198), [704](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/87791), [707](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/88590), [727](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/91905), [751](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95864), [775](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/100591), [802](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/103977), [829](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/108273), [852](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/112617)).

The Open Olympiad consists of the most interesting and difficult problems proposed by our authors' team. Therefore, we decided to conduct a non-rating mirror of the Olympiad on Codeforces. The Olympiad takes place in two rounds, each consisting of 44 problems, not ordered by difficulty, and 55 hours to solve them. The difficulty of the problems is comparable to the level of Div. 1. Each problem is worth 100100 points that are distributed into multiple subtasks with different constraints that allow the participant to earn partial score. Testing is done in the IOI format, where the participant receives a full testing report on all tests in the **Online**-subtasks during the competition. The feature of the Open Olympiad is that some problems have **Offline**-subtasks, the results of which will only be available after the end of the competition. Note, that you will not have access to the scoreboard during the competition.

The competition problems were created and prepared by [Mangooste](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mangooste "International Grandmaster Mangooste"), [vaaven](https://codeforces.com/profile/vaaven "Master vaaven"), [Tikhon228](https://codeforces.com/profile/Tikhon228 "Grandmaster Tikhon228"), [ViktorSM](https://codeforces.com/profile/ViktorSM "Expert ViktorSM"), [isaf27](https://codeforces.com/profile/isaf27 "International Grandmaster isaf27"), [TheEvilBird](https://codeforces.com/profile/TheEvilBird "Expert TheEvilBird"), [sevlll777](https://codeforces.com/profile/sevlll777 "Grandmaster sevlll777"), [Papaz239](https://codeforces.com/profile/Papaz239 "Candidate Master Papaz239") Ð¸ [pakhomovee](https://codeforces.com/profile/pakhomovee "Master pakhomovee") guided by [Ormlis](https://codeforces.com/profile/Ormlis "Legendary Grandmaster Ormlis"), [grphil](https://codeforces.com/profile/grphil "Master grphil") and Helen Andreeva.

The mirror on Codeforces will take place in [Friday, March 8, 2024 at 15:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=8&month=3&year=2024&hour=12&min=5&sec=0&p1=166) and [Saturday, March 9, 2024 at 15:05UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=9&month=3&year=2024&hour=12&min=5&sec=0&p1=166).
