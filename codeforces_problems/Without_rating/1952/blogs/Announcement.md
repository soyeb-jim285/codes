# Announcement

Hello, ~~April Fools lovers~~ Codeforces!

We, [AlperenT](https://codeforces.com/profile/AlperenT "Master AlperenT"), [flamestorm](https://codeforces.com/profile/flamestorm "Candidate Master flamestorm"), [ToxicPie9](https://codeforces.com/profile/ToxicPie9 "Candidate Master ToxicPie9"), and [willy108](https://codeforces.com/profile/willy108 "Master willy108"), would like to invite everyone on Codeforces to [April Fools Day Contest 2024](https://codeforces.com/contest/1952 "April Fools Day Contest 2024")! The 12th April Fools Day Contest will take place on [Monday, April 1, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=1&month=4&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This is a joke competition in which solving the problem is often easier than figuring out what the actual task is.

In this round, you will be given n cool bugaboos where −1≤n≤[REDACTED] and **2** hours to solve them. The contest will use extended ICPC rules (no hacks, the standings are decided by the number of solved problems and penalty time earned on them). You can submit solutions in any language allowed by Codeforces, unless the problem says otherwise. 

Please note that the round is **unrated** and that the penalty for a **wrong submission** is **10** minutes.

To get an idea of what the contest will look like, you can check out the contests of the past years: [2012](https://codeforces.com/contest/171), [2013](https://codeforces.com/contest/290), [2014](https://codeforces.com/contest/409), [2016](https://codeforces.com/contest/656), [2017](https://codeforces.com/contest/784), [2018](https://codeforces.com/contest/952), [2019](https://codeforces.com/contest/1145), [2020](https://codeforces.com/contest/1331), [2021](https://codeforces.com/contest/1505), [2022](https://codeforces.com/contest/1663), [2023](https://codeforces.com/contest/1812). (It has been **12** years since the first April Fools Day Contest, thank you [Nickolas](https://codeforces.com/profile/Nickolas "Expert Nickolas")!)

Please do not send any clarification requests in the contest, as we definitely will not be sending funny responses like we did last year.

Good luck, and **have fun**!
