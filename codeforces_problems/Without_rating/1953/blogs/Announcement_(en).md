**2023 Post World Finals Online ICPC Challenge powered by Huawei**:

Start: [May 6, 2024 15:00 UTC](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=The+2023+Post+World+Finals+Online+ICPC+Challenge+&iso=20240506T15&p1=1440)

Finish: [May 20, 2024 14:59 UTC](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=The+2023+Post+World+Finals+Online+ICPC+Challenge%3A+finish+time&iso=20240520T1459&p1=1440)

We hope you'll enjoy this complex Challenge!

#### Problem

We are glad to propose to you an exciting challenge **“Accuracy-preserving summation algorithm”**, which is prepared by Huawei Computing Product Line.

With this challenge, we focus on summation algorithms of floating point numbers in different precisions with the goal to use the lowest possible precision without losing too much of the accuracy of the end result. This problem arises in high-performance computing as lower precision can be computed faster. At the same time it also loses accuracy faster and can even lose it completely. Finding the right balance between fast low precision calculations and higher precision intermediate summations is a challenging task on modern architectures, and you would have an opportunity to try addressing this challenge
