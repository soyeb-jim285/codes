<h1 style='text-align: center;'> F2. Dyn-scripted Robot (Hard Version)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 3 seconds</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $k \le 10^{12}$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Given a $w \times h$ rectangle on the $Oxy$ plane, with points $(0, 0)$ at the bottom-left and $(w, h)$ at the top-right of the rectangle.

You also have a robot initially at point $(0, 0)$ and a script $s$ of $n$ characters. Each character is either L, R, U, or D, which tells the robot to move left, right, up, or down respectively.

The robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the script $s$ as follows:

* If it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R's (and vice versa, all R's to L's).
* If it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D's (and vice versa, all D's to U's).

Then, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it couldn't execute.

All changes to the string $s$ will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how many times will the robot move to the point $(0, 0)$ in total? 
## Note

 that the initial position does NOT count.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $k$, $w$, and $h$ ($1 \le n, w, h \le 10^6$; $1 \le k \le 10^{12}$).

The second line contains a single string $s$ of size $n$ ($s_i \in \{\texttt{L}, \texttt{R}, \texttt{U}, \texttt{D}\}$) — the script to be executed.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.

### Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot reaches $(0, 0)$ when executing script $s$ for $k$ times continuously.

## Note

In the first test case, the robot only moves up and right for the first two executions. After that, it occupies the position $(2, 2)$. For the next two executions, it moves down and left and finishes at $(0, 0)$. So the answer is $1$.

In the second test case, each time executing the script the robot visits the origin twice. And since $k=2$, it visits the origin $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ times overall.
