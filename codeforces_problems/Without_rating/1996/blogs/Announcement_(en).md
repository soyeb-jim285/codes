Hewwo Cowodeforcers!
--------------------

[sum](https://codeforces.com/profile/sum "Master sum") and I are overjoyed to welcome you to participate in [Codeforces Round 962 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1996 "Codeforces Round 962 (Div. 3)") on [Friday, July 26, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=26&month=7&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166). This contest is the last stop on our mission to problemset for every division. We hope you've been enjoying our stuff so far!

The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). Thus, solutions will be judged on preliminary tests during the round, and after the round, it will be a 12-hour phase of **open hacks**. After open hacks all accepted solutions will be rejudged on successful hacks.

You will be given **7 problems** and **2 hours and 15 minutes** to solve them.

Note that the **penalty** for each wrong submission in this round is **10 minutes**.

[Remember](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59228) that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a *trusted participant of the third division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them)
* do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.**

We would like to orz the following individuals for making the contest possible:
