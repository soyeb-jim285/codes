Hello Codeforces!

[flamestorm](https://codeforces.com/profile/flamestorm "Master flamestorm"), [mesanu](https://codeforces.com/profile/mesanu "Candidate Master mesanu") and I want to invite you to [Codeforces Round 964 (Div. 4)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1999 "Codeforces Round 964 (Div. 4)").

It starts on [Tuesday, August 6, 2024 at 20:35UTC+6](https://codeforces.com/https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=8&year=2024&hour=17&min=35&sec=0&p1=166).

The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:

 * 5-8 tasks;
* ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission;
* 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points)
* after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated
* by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are an unrated participant/newcomer).

Additionally, there might be problems that are interactive, so please read the guide of [interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307) before the contest.

We urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism but to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest for the official participants.

Only *trusted participants of the fourth division* will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behaviour. To qualify as *a trusted participant of the fourth division*, you must:

 * take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),
* do not have a point of 1400 or higher in the rating.

**Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the fourth division or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), then the round will be rated for you.**
