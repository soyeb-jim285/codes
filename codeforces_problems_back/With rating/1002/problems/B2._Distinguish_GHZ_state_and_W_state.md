You are given *N* qubits (2 ≤ *N* ≤ 8) which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:

* ![](images/acb08ce15c611d90dc85f731accccd9bbfac8fd3.png) state, or
* ![](images/6c9f6af141e015f20a73dd1c0e8749da68f71ba6.png) state. Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was GHZ state or 1 if it was W state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.

You have to implement an operation which takes an array of *N* qubits as an input and returns an integer. 

Your code should have the following signature:


```
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;  
  
    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int  
    {  
        body  
        {  
            // your code here  
        }  
    }  
}
```
