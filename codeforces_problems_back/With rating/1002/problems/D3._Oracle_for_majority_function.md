Implement a quantum oracle on 3 qubits which implements a majority function. Majority function on 3-bit vectors is defined as follows: ![](images/f1b82a29ad1451ba70f5de92d7fdba87148a674f.png) if vector ![](images/f8914399eadbd8be3c3196100658870e03c61fee.png) has two or three 1s, and 0 if it has zero or one 1s.

For an explanation on how this type of quantum oracles works, see [Introduction to quantum oracles](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/60319).

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:

* an array of 3 qubits *x* in arbitrary state (input register),
* a qubit *y* in arbitrary state (output qubit).

The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.

Your code should have the following signature:


```
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;  
  
    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : ()  
    {  
        body  
        {  
            // your code here  
        }  
    }  
}
```
