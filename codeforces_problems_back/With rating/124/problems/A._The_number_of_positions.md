Petr stands in line of *n* people, but he doesn't know exactly which position he occupies. He can say that there are no less than *a* people standing in front of him and no more than *b* people standing behind him. Find the number of different positions Petr can occupy.

## Input

The only line contains three integers *n*, *a* and *b* (0 ≤ *a*, *b* < *n* ≤ 100).

## Output

Print the single number — the number of the sought positions.

## Examples

## Input


```
3 1 1  

```
## Output

2  

```
## Input


```
5 2 3  

```
## Output

The possible positions in the first sample are: 2 and 3 (if we number the positions starting with 1).

In the second sample they are 3, 4 and 5.
