Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by $3$ or end with the digit $3$ in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.

Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than $0$) integers which he likes: $1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, \dots$. ## Output

 the $k$-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from $1$).

## Input

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 1000$).

## Output

For each test case, output in a separate line one integer $x$ — the $k$-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.

## Example

## Input


```

10
1
2

4
5
6
7

9
1000

```
## Output


```

1
2
4
5
7
8
10
11
