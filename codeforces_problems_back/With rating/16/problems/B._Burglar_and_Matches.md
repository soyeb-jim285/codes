A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are *m* containers, in the *i*-th container there are *a**i* matchboxes, and each matchbox contains *b**i* matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold *n* matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than *n* matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.

## Input

The first line of the input contains integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 2·108) and integer *m* (1 ≤ *m* ≤ 20). The *i* + 1-th line contains a pair of numbers *a**i* and *b**i* (1 ≤ *a**i* ≤ 108, 1 ≤ *b**i* ≤ 10). All the input numbers are integer.
