Given an undirected graph $G$, we say that a neighbour ordering is an ordered list of all the neighbours of a vertex for each of the vertices of $G$. Consider a given neighbour ordering of $G$ and three vertices $u$, $v$ and $w$, such that $v$ is a neighbor of $u$ and $w$. We write $u <_{v} w$ if $u$ comes after $w$ in $v$'s neighbor list.

A neighbour ordering is said to be good if, for each simple cycle $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_c$ of the graph, one of the following is satisfied:

* $v_1 <_{v_2} v_3, v_2 <_{v_3} v_4, \ldots, v_{c-2} <_{v_{c-1}} v_c, v_{c-1} <_{v_c} v_1, v_c <_{v_1} v_2$.
* $v_1 >_{v_2} v_3, v_2 >_{v_3} v_4, \ldots, v_{c-2} >_{v_{c-1}} v_c, v_{c-1} >_{v_c} v_1, v_c >_{v_1} v_2$.

Given a graph $G$, determine whether there exists a good neighbour ordering for it and construct one if it does.

## Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$), the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.

The next $m$ lines each contain two integers $u, v$ ($0 \leq u, v < n$), denoting that there is an edge connecting vertices $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there are no loops or multiple edges between the same vertices.

The sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ for all test cases are at most $3 \cdot 10^5$.

## Output

For each test case, output one line with YES if there is a good neighbour ordering, otherwise output one line with NO. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

If the answer is YES, additionally output $n$ lines describing a good neighbour ordering. In the $i$-th line, output the neighbours of vertex $i$ in order. 

If there are multiple good neigbour orderings, print any.
