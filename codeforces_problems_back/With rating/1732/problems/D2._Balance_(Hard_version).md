This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version there are remove queries.

Initially you have a set containing one element — $0$. You need to handle $q$ queries of the following types:

* + $x$ — add the integer $x$ to the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is not contained in the set;
* - $x$ — remove the integer $x$ from the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is contained in the set;
* ? $k$ — find the $k\text{-mex}$ of the set.

In our problem, we define the $k\text{-mex}$ of a set of integers as the smallest non-negative integer $x$ that is divisible by $k$ and which is not contained in the set.

## Input

The first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The following $q$ lines describe the queries.

An addition query of integer $x$ is given in the format + $x$ ($1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}$). It is guaranteed that $x$ is not contained in the set.

A remove query of integer $x$ is given in the format - $x$ ($1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}$). It is guaranteed that $x$ is contained in the set.

A search query of $k\text{-mex}$ is given in the format ? $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}$).

It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of type ?.

## Output

For each query of type ? output a single integer — the $k\text{-mex}$ of the set.

## Examples

## Input


```

18+ 1+ 2? 1+ 4? 2+ 6? 3+ 7+ 8? 1? 2+ 5? 1+ 1000000000000000000? 1000000000000000000- 4? 1? 2
```
## Output


```

```
## Input


```

10+ 100? 100+ 200? 100- 100? 100+ 50? 50- 50? 50
```
## Output


```

200
300
100
100
50

```
## Note

In the first example:

After the first and second queries, the set will contain elements $\{0, 1, 2\}$. The smallest non-negative number that is divisible by $1$ and is not in the set is $3$.

After the fourth query, the set will contain the elements $\{0, 1, 2, 4\}$. The smallest non-negative number that is divisible by $2$ and is not in the set is $6$.

In the second example:

* Initially, the set contains only the element $\{0\}$.
* After adding an integer $100$ the set contains elements $\{0, 100\}$.
* $100\text{-mex}$ of the set is $200$.
* After adding an integer $200$ the set contains elements $\{0, 100, 200\}$.
* $100\text{-mex}$ of the set $300$.
* After removing an integer $100$ the set contains elements $\{0, 200\}$.
* $100\text{-mex}$ of the set is $100$.
* After adding an integer $50$ the set contains elements $\{0, 50, 200\}$.
* $50\text{-mex}$ of the set is $100$.
* After removing an integer $50$ the set contains elements $\{0, 200\}$.
* $100\text{-mex}$ of the set is $50$.
