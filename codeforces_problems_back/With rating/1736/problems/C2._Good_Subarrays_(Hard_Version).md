<h1 style='text-align: center;'> C2. Good Subarrays (Hard Version)</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 3 seconds</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

This is the hard version of this problem. In this version, we have queries. ## Note

 that we do not have multiple test cases in this version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

An array $b$ of length $m$ is good if for all $i$ the $i$-th element is greater than or equal to $i$. In other words, $b$ is good if and only if $b_i \geq i$ for all $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$).

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ positive integers, and you are asked $q$ queries. 

In each query, you are given two integers $p$ and $x$ ($1 \leq p,x \leq n$). You have to do $a_p := x$ (assign $x$ to $a_p$). In the updated array, find the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$, where $1 \le l \le r \le n$, such that the array $[a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r]$ is good.

## Note

 that all queries are independent, which means after each query, the initial array $a$ is restored. 

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$).

The third line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.

Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $p_j$ and $x_j$ ($1 \leq p_j, x_j \leq n$) – the description of the $j$-th query.

## Output

For each query, print the number of suitable pairs of indices after making the change. 

## Examples

## Input


```

4
2 4 1 4
3
2 4
3 3
2 1

```
## Output


```

6
10
5

```
## Input


```

5
1 1 3 2 1
3
1 3
2 5
4 5

```
## Output


```

7
9
8

```
## Note

Here are notes for first example.

In first query, after update $a=[2,4,1,4]$. Now $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, $(1,2)$, and $(3,4)$ are suitable pairs.

In second query, after update $a=[2,4,3,4]$. Now all subarrays of $a$ are good.

In third query, after update $a=[2,1,1,4]$. Now $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, and $(3,4)$ are suitable.
