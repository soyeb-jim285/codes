Pak Chanek has a prime number$^\dagger$ $n$. Find a prime number $m$ such that $n + m$ is not prime.

$^\dagger$ A prime number is a number with exactly $2$ factors. The first few prime numbers are $2,3,5,7,11,13,\ldots$. In particular, $1$ is not a prime number.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.

The only line of each test case contains a prime number $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$).

## Output

For each test case, output a line containing a prime number $m$ ($2 \leq m \leq 10^5$) such that $n + m$ is not prime. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such $m$ always exists.

If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them. 

## Example

## Input


```

37275619
```
## Output


```

2
7
47837

```
## Note

In the first test case, $m = 2$, which is prime, and $n + m = 7 + 2 = 9$, which is not prime.

In the second test case, $m = 7$, which is prime, and $n + m = 2 + 7 = 9$, which is not prime.

In the third test case, $m = 47837$, which is prime, and $n + m = 75619 + 47837 = 123456$, which is not prime.
