On March 14, the day of the number $\pi$ is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

Polycarp was told at school that the number $\pi$ is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number $\pi$ by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.

Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered $\pi$ as $3.1415$, he wrote out 31415.

Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number $\pi$ Polycarp actually remembers correctly.

## Input

The first line of the input data contains the single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) — the number of test cases in the test. 

Each test case is described by a single string of digits $n$, which was written out by Polycarp.

The string $n$ contains up to $30$ digits.

## Output

## Output

 $t$ integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number $\pi$ Polycarp remembers correctly.
