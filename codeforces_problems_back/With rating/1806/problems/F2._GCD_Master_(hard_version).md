This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ and two integers $m$ and $k$. Each element in $a$ satisfies $1\le a_i \le m$.

In one operation, you choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i < j \le |a|$, then append $\gcd(a_i,a_j)$ to the back of the array and delete $a_i$ and $a_j$ from the array. ## Note

 that the length of the array decreases by one after this operation.

Find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly $k$ operations.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^5$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$; $1\le m \le 9\cdot 10^{18}$; $1 \le k \le n-1$).

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le m$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum possible sum of the array after performing $k$ operations optimally.

## Example

## Input


```

43 8 14 7 85 114514 27 2 4 1 63 1919810 22 3 33 9000000000000000000 19000000000000000000 9000000000000000000 9000000000000000000
```
## Output


```

11
14
1
18000000000000000000

```
## Note

In the first test case, the best way is to choose $i=1$, $j=3$ in the first operation. The final sequence is $[7,4]$.
