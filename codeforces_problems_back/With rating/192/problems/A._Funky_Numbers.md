As you very well know, this year's funkiest numbers are so called triangular numbers (that is, integers that are representable as ![](images/48cf4d33526da5209922c993ddf2320013993147.png), where *k* is some positive integer), and the coolest numbers are those that are representable as a sum of two triangular numbers.

A well-known hipster Andrew adores everything funky and cool but unfortunately, he isn't good at maths. Given number *n*, help him define whether this number can be represented by a sum of two triangular numbers (not necessarily different)!

## Input

The first input line contains an integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 109).

## Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes), if *n* can be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers, otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).

## Examples

## Input


```
256  

```
## Output


```
YES  

```
## Input


```
512  

```
## Output


```
NO  

```
## Note

In the first sample number ![](images/92095692c6ea93e9e3b837a0408ba7543549d5b2.png).

In the second sample number 512 can not be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers.
