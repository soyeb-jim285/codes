This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $t$ and $n$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

For a binary$^\dagger$ pattern $p$ and a binary string $q$, both of length $m$, $q$ is called $p$-good if for every $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$), there exist indices $l$ and $r$ such that: 

* $1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m$, and
* $p_i$ is a mode$^\ddagger$ of the string $q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r}$.

For a pattern $p$, let $f(p)$ be the minimum possible number of $\mathtt{1}$s in a $p$-good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).

You are given a binary string $s$ of size $n$. Find $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i}^{n} f(s_i s_{i+1} \ldots s_j).$$ In other words, you need to sum the values of $f$ over all $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ substrings of $s$.

$^\dagger$ A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters $\mathtt{0}$ and $\mathtt{1}$.

$^\ddagger$ Character $c$ is a mode of string $t$ of length $m$ if the number of occurrences of $c$ in $t$ is at least $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$. For example, $\mathtt{0}$ is a mode of $\mathtt{010}$, $\mathtt{1}$ is not a mode of $\mathtt{010}$, and both $\mathtt{0}$ and $\mathtt{1}$ are modes of $\mathtt{011010}$.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the binary string $s$.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of only characters $\mathtt{0}$ and $\mathtt{1}$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.

## Output

For each test case, output the sum of values of $f$ over all substrings of $s$.

## Example

## Input


```

4112105000002011110110000000111111
```
## Output


```

1
2
0
346

```
## Note

In the first test case, the only $\mathtt{1}$-good string is $\mathtt{1}$. Thus, $f(\mathtt{1})=1$.

In the second test case, $f(\mathtt{10})=1$ because $\mathtt{01}$ is $\mathtt{10}$-good, and $\mathtt{00}$ is not $\mathtt{10}$-good. Thus, the answer is $f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$.

In the third test case, $f$ equals to $0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5$. Thus, the answer is $0$.
