The two versions of the problem are different. You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$. Start with $c = 0$. Then, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$ (in increasing order) do exactly one of the following: 

* Option $1$: set $c$ to $c + a_i$.
* Option $2$: set $c$ to $|c + a_i|$, where $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$.

Let the maximum final value of $c$ after the procedure described above be equal to $k$. Find $k$.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).

The second line of each case contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ ($-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$).

The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the value of $k$.

## Example

## Input


```

5410 -9 -3 481 4 3 4 1 4 3 43-1 -2 -34-1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 100000000041 9 8 4
```
## Output


```

6
24
6
4000000000
22

```
## Note

In the first test case, if we set $c$ to its absolute value every time we add to it, we end up with $6$. It can be shown that this is the maximum result.

In the second test case, taking the absolute value will never change anything, so we can just sum the array without doing anything to get $24$.

In the third test case, it is optimal to wait until the end to set $c$ to its absolute value, resulting in an answer of $6$.
