<h1 style='text-align: center;'> A. Creating Words</h1>

<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 1 second</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

Matthew is given two strings $a$ and $b$, both of length $3$. He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of $a$ with the first character of $b$. He wants you to output $a$ and $b$ after the swap.

Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

## Input

The first line contains $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$)  — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, $a$ and $b$, both of length $3$. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

## Output

For each test case, after the swap, output $a$ and $b$, separated by a space.

## Example

## Input


```

6bit setcat doghot doguwu owocat catzzz zzz
```
## Output


```

sit bet
dat cog
dot hog
owu uwo
cat cat
zzz zzz

```
