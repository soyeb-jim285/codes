This round is supported by NEAR!

NEAR was founded in 2017 by Illia Polosukhin, one of the creators of Transformers, and Alex Skidanov as an attempt to build an artificial system capable of solving competitive programming problems. You can read more about that attempt [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59746).

Ultimately, NEAR pivoted into building a blockchain protocol, which it launched in 2020.

This year, NEAR started [NEAR.AI](https://codeforces.com/https://near.ai/nearai-master-plan), a new lab with a mission to build AI systems that are open and available to everyone, instead of being controlled by a few mega-corporations.

One of the areas of focus is making models capable of reasoning reliably, and for that, competitive programming problems provide a great environment. To help us build it, we invite all members of the Codeforces community with a rating of Specialist or higher (1400+) to help us annotate step-by-step explanations of solutions to competitive programming problems. We want to annotate a very large set of problems of all difficulty levels, and pay relatively high rewards in NEAR per annotation. **You can join the system following this: [https://codeforces.com/settings/near-connect-account](https://codeforces.com/settings/near-connect-account)**

Thanks to NEAR for providing the following **prizes** to the contestants:

 * 1st place: 512 Ⓝ;
* 2nd and 3rd places: 256 Ⓝ each;
* 4th to 7th places: 128 Ⓝ each;
* and so on;
* 512th to 1023th places: 1 Ⓝ each.

**Score distribution**: $500-1000-1250-2000-2000-2500-2750-3750$

Good luck!
