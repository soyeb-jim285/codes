Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains *x* (*x* ≥ 1) potatoes, and the second — *y* (*y* ≥ 1) potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains *x* potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (*x* + *y*) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than *n*, and, secondly, was divisible by *k*.

Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

## Input

The first line of input contains three integers *y*, *k*, *n* (1 ≤ *y*, *k*, *n* ≤ 109; ![](images/e8f8616e518b67af73332593c4c73ae9f207dc04.png)  ≤ 105).

## Output

Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of *x* in ascending order. You should print each possible value of *x* exactly once.

If there are no such values of *x* print a single integer -1.

## Examples

## Input


```
10 1 10  

```
## Output


```
-1  

```
## Input


```
10 6 40
