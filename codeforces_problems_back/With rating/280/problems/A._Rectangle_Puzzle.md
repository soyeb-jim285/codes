You are given two rectangles on a plane. The centers of both rectangles are located in the origin of coordinates (meaning the center of the rectangle's symmetry). The first rectangle's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes: the length of the side that is parallel to the *Ox* axis, equals *w*, the length of the side that is parallel to the *Oy* axis, equals *h*. The second rectangle can be obtained by rotating the first rectangle relative to the origin of coordinates by angle α.

 ![](images/b997a953b748780107b3f45c318ffd00eca6439a.png) Your task is to find the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles. This region is shaded in the picture.

## Input

The first line contains three integers *w*, *h*, α (1 ≤ *w*, *h* ≤ 106; 0 ≤ α ≤ 180). Angle α is given in degrees.

## Output

In a single line print a real number — the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles.

The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10- 6.
