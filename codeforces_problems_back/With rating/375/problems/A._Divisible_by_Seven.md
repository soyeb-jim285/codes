You have number *a*, whose decimal representation quite luckily contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9. Rearrange the digits in its decimal representation so that the resulting number will be divisible by 7.

Number *a* doesn't contain any leading zeroes and contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9 (it also can contain another digits). The resulting number also mustn't contain any leading zeroes.

## Input

The first line contains positive integer *a* in the decimal record. It is guaranteed that the record of number *a* contains digits: 1, 6, 8, 9. Number *a* doesn't contain any leading zeroes. The decimal representation of number *a* contains at least 4 and at most 106 characters.

## Output

Print a number in the decimal notation without leading zeroes â€” the result of the permutation.

If it is impossible to rearrange the digits of the number *a* in the required manner, print 0.

## Examples
