Vasya is studying in the last class of school and soon he will take exams. He decided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function *P*(*x*) = *a*0 + *a*1*x*1 + ... + *a**n**x**n*. Numbers *a**i* are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative integer *n* is called a degree of a polynomial.

Vasya has made a bet with his friends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the problem: "Determine how many polynomials *P*(*x*) exist with integer non-negative coefficients so that ![](images/022f26a75e278ec50b558954524ca5729e932807.png), and ![](images/0212320a6b840272697461ac14a2563310211a70.png), where ![](images/95310776bcda3053fea9e3a9f129d60508d2d8c1.png) and *b* are given positive integers"? 

Vasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.

## Input

The input contains three integer positive numbers ![](images/ae773843333f7d3b00d2c2b7e457ab15d35f2a11.png) no greater than 1018.

## Output

If there is an infinite number of such polynomials, then print "inf" without quotes, otherwise print the reminder of an answer modulo 109 + 7.
