A soldier wants to buy *w* bananas in the shop. He has to pay *k* dollars for the first banana, 2*k* dollars for the second one and so on (in other words, he has to pay *i*·*k* dollars for the *i*-th banana). 

He has *n* dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend soldier to buy *w* bananas?
