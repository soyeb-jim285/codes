Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined:

He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after *n* moves.

## Input

The only line of the input contains integer *n* (0 ≤ *n* ≤ 1018) — the number of Ayrat's moves.

## Output

Print two integers *x* and *y* — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.

## Examples

## Input


```
