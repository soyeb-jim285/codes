The INI file format is a de facto standard for configuration files. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure. They are commonly associated with Microsoft Windows, but are also used on other platforms.

Each line in INI-file stands for key-value mapping or defines new section. A key-value line has a format "key=value",where key — is the name of some property, and value — it's value. It is possible that it will be spaces from the both sides of key and/or value, the spaces should be ignored.

A section line has a format "[section]". It means that all key-value lines after it define properties of the specified section. Of cause, the following section line changes the current section. A section line may have spaces around any of brackets.

Also you should ignore comment lines — the first non-space character of comment line is ";".

You task is to write the program which will format given INI-file in a special way: 

* first, print key-value lines which do not belong to any section;
* print all the sections in the lexicographical (alphabetical) order of their names;
* inside each of two previous items, order key-value lines lexicographically by "key";
* if there are more than one key-value lines with the same key inside a single section (or outside any sections), leave only one line (which appears later in the input data);
* remove all redundant spaces and lines.
## Input

The first line contains single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 510) — the number of lines in given INI-file.

The rest of the input contains a valid INI-file in *n* lines. Values of section, key and value contain only Latin letters, digits, "." and/or "-".

Each line has length not exceeding 255 characters and not less than 1 character. The total length of all the lines does’t exceed 10000.

## Output

Print formatted INI-file.

## Examples

## Input


```
11  
a= 1  
b=a  
a = 2  
 ; comment  
[z]  
1=2  
[y]  
2=3  
[z]  
2=1  
[w]  

```
## Output


```
a=2  
b=a  
[w]  
[y]  
2=3  
[z]  
1=2  
2=1  

```
