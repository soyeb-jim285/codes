Alyona has built *n* towers by putting small cubes some on the top of others. Each cube has size 1 × 1 × 1. A tower is a non-zero amount of cubes standing on the top of each other. The towers are next to each other, forming a row.

Sometimes Alyona chooses some segment towers, and put on the top of each tower several cubes. Formally, Alyouna chooses some segment of towers from *l**i* to *r**i* and adds *d**i* cubes on the top of them.

Let the sequence *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* be the heights of the towers from left to right. Let's call as a segment of towers *a**l*, *a**l* + 1, ..., *a**r* a hill if the following condition holds: there is integer *k* (*l* ≤ *k* ≤ *r*) such that *a**l* < *a**l* + 1 < *a**l* + 2 < ... < *a**k* > *a**k* + 1 > *a**k* + 2 > ... > *a**r*.

After each addition of *d**i* cubes on the top of the towers from *l**i* to *r**i*, Alyona wants to know the maximum width among all hills. The width of a hill is the number of towers in it.

## Input

The first line contain single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 3·105) — the number of towers.

The second line contain *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1 ≤ *a**i* ≤ 109) — the number of cubes in each tower. 

The third line contain single integer *m* (1 ≤ *m* ≤ 3·105) — the number of additions.

The next *m* lines contain 3 integers each. The *i*-th of these lines contains integers *l**i*, *r**i* and *d**i* (1 ≤ *l* ≤ *r* ≤ *n*, 1 ≤ *d**i* ≤ 109), that mean that Alyona puts *d**i* cubes on the tio of each of the towers from *l**i* to *r**i*.

## Output

Print *m* lines. In *i*-th line print the maximum width of the hills after the *i*-th addition.

## Example

## Input


```
5  
5 5 5 5 5  
3  
1 3 2  
2 2 1  
4 4 1  

```
## Output


```
2  
4  
5  

```
## Note

The first sample is as follows:

After addition of 2 cubes on the top of each towers from the first to the third, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to [7, 7, 7, 5, 5]. The hill with maximum width is [7, 5], thus the maximum width is 2.

After addition of 1 cube on the second tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to [7, 8, 7, 5, 5]. The hill with maximum width is now [7, 8, 7, 5], thus the maximum width is 4.

After addition of 1 cube on the fourth tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to [7, 8, 7, 6, 5]. The hill with maximum width is now [7, 8, 7, 6, 5], thus the maximum width is 5.
