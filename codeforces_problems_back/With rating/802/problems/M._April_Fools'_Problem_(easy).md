The marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC2 – this one. It involves numbers *n*, *k* and a sequence of *n* positive integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n*. They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.

However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!

## Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1 ≤ *k* ≤ *n* ≤ 2200). The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1, ..., *a**n* (1 ≤ *a**i* ≤ 104).

## Output

## Output

 one number.
