Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly *N* city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly *N* blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.

## Input
