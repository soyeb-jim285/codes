Implement a quantum oracle on $N$ qubits which checks whether the number of bits equal to 1 in the input vector $\vec{x}$ is divisible by 3 (i.e., implements the function $f(\vec{x}) = 1$ if the number of $x_i = 1$ in $\vec{x}$ is divisible by 3, and 0 otherwise).

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:

* an array of $N$ ($1 \le N \le 9$) qubits $x$ in an arbitrary state (input register),
* a qubit $y$ in an arbitrary state (output qubit),

and performs a transformation $|x\rangle|y\rangle \rightarrow |x\rangle|y \oplus f(x)\rangle$. The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits. Note that the input register $x$ has to remain unchanged after applying the operation.

Your code should have the following signature:


```
namespace Solution {  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;  
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;  
  
    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit {  
        body (...) {  
            // your code here  
        }  
        adjoint auto;  
    }  
}
```
Note: the operation has to have an adjoint specified for it; adjoint auto means that the adjoint will be generated automatically. For details on adjoint, see [Operation Declarations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/language/file-structure#operation-declarations).

You are not allowed to use measurements in your operation.
