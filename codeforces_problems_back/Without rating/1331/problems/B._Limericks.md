```
There was once young lass called Mary,    
Whose jokes were occasionally scary.    
On this April's Fool    
Fixed limerick rules    
Allowed her to trip the unwary.  
  
Can she fill all the lines  
To work at all times?  
On juggling the words  
Right around two-thirds  
She nearly ran out of rhymes.
