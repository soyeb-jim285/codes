<h5 style='text-align: center;'>time limit per test: 2 seconds</h5>
<h5 style='text-align: center;'>memory limit per test: 256 megabytes</h5>

Write a program that is compilable simultaneously in two languages: C++ (GCC 10.3.1, -std=c++11) and FreePascal (3.0.4).

It absolutely does not matter what this program does, the only requirement is that it successfully compiles into an executable file in both C++ and Pascal.

Please use the language Text to submit your solution. Just choose Text as a language in the submission form.

The submitted file can't exceed 2048 bytes. It should compile fast on both compilers.
