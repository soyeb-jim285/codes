## Input

Sup, gimme a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 4$) homie uwu :3

## Output

If $x = 1$, spit out some based code that, like when ya feed it two integers $a$ and $b$, it hands over their sum.

If $x = 2$, slap some based code that takes an integer $a$ and returns its absolute value like magic, no cap.

If $x = 3$, check this out: blaze some based code that grabs an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) and an array $a$ of $n$ distinct integers, then flexes the maximum value real quick.

If $x = 4$, toss me some based code that snatches an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$), an array $a$ of $n$ distinct integers and an integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le n$), then nails down that $k$-th largest value in the array. Get it, fam!

## Examples

yoink a
bruh b is lowkey just 0
rip this b fell off by a
vibe check a ratios b
simp for 7
bruh a is lowkey just b
yeet a
go touch some grass

```

3
```
## Output


```

yoink n
yoink a
bruh m is lowkey just a[0]
bruh i is lowkey just 1
vibe check n ratios i
simp for 9
yeet m
go touch some grass
vibe check a[i] ratios m
bruh m is lowkey just a[i]
*slaps 1 on top of i*
simp for 5

```
## Input

## Note

Slide into the "My Submissions" page and vibe check ur code by clicking on its ID. You'll see just how based or cringe it is.
