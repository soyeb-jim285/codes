It's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.

After Farmer John arrived at his farm, he counted $n$ legs. It is known only chickens and cows live on the farm, and a chicken has $2$ legs while a cow has $4$. 

What is the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted the legs of all animals? 

## Input

The first line contains single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^3$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^3$, $n$ is even).

## Output

For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm.

## Example
