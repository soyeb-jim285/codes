CSES - Acyclic Graph Edges

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so
that the resulting directed graph is acyclic.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of nodes and
edges. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $m$ lines describing the edges. Each line has two
distinct integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.

# Output

Print $m$ lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge from node $a$ to node $b$. You can
print any valid solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 ```

Output:

``` 1 2 3 2 3 1 ```
