There are $n$ apples with known weights. Your task is to divide the apples
into two groups so that the difference between the weights of the groups is
minimal.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of apples.

The next line has $n$ integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$: the weight of each apple.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum difference between the weights of the groups.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 20$
  * $1 \le p_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 3 2 7 4 1 ```

Output:

``` 1 ```

Explanation: Group 1 has weights 2, 3 and 4 (total weight 9), and group 2 has
