CSES - Apples and Bananas

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ apples and $m$ bananas, and each of them has an integer weight
between $1 \ldots k$. Your task is to calculate, for each weight $w$ between
$2 \dots 2k$, the number of ways we can choose an apple and a banana whose
combined weight is $w$.

# Input

The first input line contains three integers $k$, $n$ and $m$: the number $k$,
the number of apples and the number of bananas.

The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$: weight of each
apple.

The last line contains $m$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$: weight of each
banana.

# Output

For each integer $w$ between $2 \ldots 2k$ print the number of ways to choose
an apple and a banana whose combined weight is $w$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le k,n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a_i \le k$
  * $1 \le b_i \le k$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 3 4 5 2 5 4 3 2 3 ```

Output:

``` 0 0 1 2 1 2 4 2 0 ```

Explanation: For example for $w$ = $8$ there are $4$ different ways: we can
pick an apple of weight $5$ in two different ways and a banana of weight $3$
in two different ways.
