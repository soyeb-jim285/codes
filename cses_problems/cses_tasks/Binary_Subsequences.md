CSES - Binary Subsequences

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to find a minimum length bit string that has exactly $n$ distinct
subsequences.

For example, a correct solution for $n=6$ is `101` whose distinct subsequences
are `0`, `1`, `01`, `10`, `11` and `101`.

# Input

The only input line has an integer $n$.

# Output

Print one bit string: a solution to the task. You can print any valid
solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 6 ```

Output:

``` 101 ```
