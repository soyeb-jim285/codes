CSES - Coin Collector

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A game has $n$ rooms and $m$ tunnels between them. Each room has a certain
number of coins. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect while
moving through the tunnels when you can freely choose your starting and ending
room?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of rooms and
tunnels. The rooms are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

Then, there are $n$ integers $k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n$: the number of coins in each
room.

Finally, there are $m$ lines describing the tunnels. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is a tunnel from room $a$ to room $b$. Each tunnel
is a one-way tunnel.

# Output

Print one integer: the maximum number of coins you can collect.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le k_i \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 4 4 5 2 7 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 4 ```

Output:

``` 16 ```
