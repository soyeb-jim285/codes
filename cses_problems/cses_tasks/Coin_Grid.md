CSES - Coin Grid

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There is an $n \times n$ grid whose each square is empty or has a coin. On
each move, you can remove all coins in a row or column.

What is the minimum number of moves after which the grid is empty?

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of the grid. The rows and
columns are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $n$ lines describing the grid. Each line has $n$
characters: each character is either `.` (empty) or `o` (coin).

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the minimum number of moves. After this, print $k$
lines describing the moves.

On each line, first print $1$ (row) or $2$ (column), and then the number of a
row or column. You can print any valid solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 100$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 ..o o.o ... ```

Output:

``` 2 1 2 2 3 ```
