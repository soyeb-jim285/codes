  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an array of $n$ positive integers. Your task is to find two
integers such that their greatest common divisor is as large as possible.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of the array.

The second line has $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$: the contents of the
array.

# Output

Print the maximum greatest common divisor.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le x_i \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 3 14 15 7 9 ```

Output:

``` 7 ```
