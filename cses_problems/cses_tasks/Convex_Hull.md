CSES - Convex Hull

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given a set of $n$ points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to
determine the convex hull of the points.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of points.

After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the points. Each line has two
integers $x$ and $y$: the coordinates of a point.

You may assume that each point is distinct, and the area of the hull is
positive.

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the number of points in the convex hull.

After this, print $k$ lines that describe the points. You can print the points
in any order. Print all points that lie on the convex hull.

# Constraints

  * $3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 6 2 1 2 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 6 3 ```

Output:

``` 4 2 1 2 5 4 4 6 3 ```
