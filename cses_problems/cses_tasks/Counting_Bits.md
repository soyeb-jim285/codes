CSES - Counting Bits

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to count the number of one bits in the binary representations of
integers between $1$ and $n$.

# Input

The only input line has an integer $n$.

# Output

Print the number of one bits in the binary representations of integers between
$1$ and $n$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^{15}$

# Example

Input:

``` 7 ```

Output:

``` 12 ```

Explanation: The binary representations of $1 \ldots 7$ are 1, 10, 11, 100,
101, 110, and 111, so there are a total of 12 one bits.
