CSES - Counting Divisors

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given $n$ integers, your task is to report for each integer the number of its
divisors.

For example, if $x=18$, the correct answer is $6$ because its divisors are
$1,2,3,6,9,18$.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of integers.

After this, there are $n$ lines, each containing an integer $x$.

# Output

For each integer, print the number of its divisors.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le x \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 16 17 18 ```

Output:

``` 5 2 6 ```
