CSES - Counting Paths

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a tree consisting of $n$ nodes, and $m$ paths in the tree.

Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that
node.

# Input

The first input line contains integers $n$ and $m$: the number of nodes and
paths. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.

Then there are $n-1$ lines describing the edges. Each line contains two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.

Finally, there are $m$ lines describing the paths. Each line contains two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is a path between nodes $a$ and $b$.

# Output

Print $n$ integers: for each node $1,2,\ldots,n$, the number of paths
containing that node.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 3 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 1 3 2 5 1 4 ```

Output:

``` 3 1 3 1 1 ```
