  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a map of a building, and your task is to count the number of its
rooms. The size of the map is $n \times m$ squares, and each square is either
floor or wall. You can walk left, right, up, and down through the floor
squares.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the height and width of the
map.

Then there are $n$ lines of $m$ characters describing the map. Each character
is either `.` (floor) or `#` (wall).

# Output

Print one integer: the number of rooms.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n,m \le 1000$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 8 ######## #..#...# ####.#.# #..#...# ######## ```

Output:

``` 3 ```
