CSES - Counting Towers

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to build a tower whose width is $2$ and height is $n$. You have
an unlimited supply of blocks whose width and height are integers.

For example, here are some possible solutions for $n=6$:
![](/file/a2fc04205fb57157bd28c9a6041601fc284681929941470fdfb15fcd4a14b4f2)
Given $n$, how many different towers can you build? Mirrored and rotated
towers are counted separately if they look different.

# Input

The first input line contains an integer $t$: the number of tests.

After this, there are $t$ lines, and each line contains an integer $n$: the
height of the tower.

# Output

For each test, print the number of towers modulo $10^9+7$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le t \le 100$
  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 2 6 1337 ```

Output:

``` 8 2864 640403945 ```
