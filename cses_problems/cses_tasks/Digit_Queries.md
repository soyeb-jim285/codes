CSES - Digit Queries

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Consider an infinite string that consists of all positive integers in
increasing order:

``` 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425... ```

Your task is to process $q$ queries of the form: what is the digit at position
$k$ in the string?

# Input

The first input line has an integer $q$: the number of queries.

After this, there are $q$ lines that describe the queries. Each line has an
integer $k$: a $1$-indexed position in the string.

# Output

For each query, print the corresponding digit.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le q \le 1000$
  * $1 \le k \le 10^{18}$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 7 19 12 ```

Output:

``` 7 4 1 ```
