CSES - Distinct Routes

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A game consists of $n$ rooms and $m$ teleporters. At the beginning of each
day, you start in room $1$ and you have to reach room $n$.

You can use each teleporter at most once during the game. How many days can
you play if you choose your routes optimally?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of rooms and
teleporters. The rooms are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $m$ lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is a teleporter from room $a$ to room $b$.

There are no two teleporters whose starting and ending room are the same.

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the maximum number of days you can play the game.
Then, print $k$ route descriptions according to the example. You can print any
valid solution.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 500$
  * $1 \le m \le 1000$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 6 7 1 2 1 3 2 6 3 4 3 5 4 6 5 6 ```

Output:

``` 2 3 1 2 6 4 1 3 4 6 ```
