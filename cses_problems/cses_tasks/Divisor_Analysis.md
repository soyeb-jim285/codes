CSES - Divisor Analysis

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an integer, your task is to find the number, sum and product of its
divisors. As an example, let us consider the number $12$:

  * the number of divisors is $6$ (they are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $12$)
  * the sum of divisors is $1+2+3+4+6+12=28$
  * the product of divisors is $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 12 = 1728$

Since the input number may be large, it is given as a prime factorization.

# Input

The first line has an integer $n$: the number of parts in the prime
factorization.

After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the factorization. Each line has
two numbers $x$ and $k$ where $x$ is a prime and $k$ is its power.

# Output

Print three integers modulo $10^9+7$: the number, sum and product of the
divisors.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $2 \le x \le 10^6$
  * each $x$ is a distinct prime
  * $1 \le k \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 2 2 2 3 1 ```

Output:

``` 6 28 1728 ```
