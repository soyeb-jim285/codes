CSES - Edit Distance

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

The _edit distance_ between two strings is the minimum number of operations
required to transform one string into the other.

The allowed operations are:

  * Add one character to the string.
  * Remove one character from the string.
  * Replace one character in the string.

For example, the edit distance between LOVE and MOVIE is 2, because you can
first replace L with M, and then add I.

Your task is to calculate the edit distance between two strings.

# Input

The first input line has a string that contains $n$ characters between A–Z.

The second input line has a string that contains $m$ characters between A–Z.

# Output

Print one integer: the edit distance between the strings.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n,m \le 5000$

# Example

Input:

``` LOVE MOVIE ```

Output:

``` 2 ```
