CSES - Factory Machines

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A factory has $n$ machines which can be used to make products. Your goal is to
make a total of $t$ products.

For each machine, you know the number of seconds it needs to make a single
product. The machines can work simultaneously, and you can freely decide their
schedule.

What is the shortest time needed to make $t$ products?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $t$: the number of machines and
products.

The next line has $n$ integers $k_1,k_2,\dots,k_n$: the time needed to make a
product using each machine.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum time needed to make $t$ products.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le t \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le k_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 7 3 2 5 ```

Output:

``` 8 ```

Explanation: Machine 1 makes two products, machine 2 makes four products and
machine 3 makes one product.
