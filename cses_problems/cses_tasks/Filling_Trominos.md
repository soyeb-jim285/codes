CSES - Filling Trominos

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to fill an $n \times m$ grid using L-trominos (three squares that
have an L-shape). For example, here is one way to fill a $4 \times 6$ grid:
![](/file/da3ce928fcf66fd793d582a1a5ad7f7f9cc37e68aa2aadacee90f99bc4271692)

# Input

The first input line has an integer $t$: the number of tests.

After that, there are $t$ lines that describe the tests. Each line has two
integers $n$ and $m$.

# Output

For each test, print YES if there is a solution, and NO otherwise.

If there is a solution, also print $n$ lines that each contain $m$ letters
between A–Z. Adjacent squares must have the same letter exactly when they
belong to the same tromino. You can print any valid solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le t \le 100$
  * $1 \le n,m \le 100$

# Example

Input:

``` 2 4 6 4 7 ```

Output:

``` YES AADDBB ACCDEB BCAEEC BBAACC NO ```
