CSES - Fixed-Length Paths I

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given a tree of $n$ nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths
that consist of exactly $k$ edges.

# Input

The first input line contains two integers $n$ and $k$: the number of nodes
and the path length. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.

Then there are $n-1$ lines describing the edges. Each line contains two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of paths.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5 ```

Output:

``` 4 ```
