CSES - Flight Discount

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to find a minimum-price flight route from Syrjälä to Metsälä. You
have one discount coupon, using which you can halve the price of any single
flight during the route. However, you can only use the coupon once.

When you use the discount coupon for a flight whose price is $x$, its price
becomes $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ (it is rounded down to an integer).

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of cities and
flight connections. The cities are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$. City 1 is Syrjälä,
and city $n$ is Metsälä.

After this there are $m$ lines describing the flights. Each line has three
integers $a$, $b$, and $c$: a flight begins at city $a$, ends at city $b$, and
its price is $c$. Each flight is unidirectional.

You can assume that it is always possible to get from Syrjälä to Metsälä.

# Output

Print one integer: the price of the cheapest route from Syrjälä to Metsälä.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$
  * $1 \le c \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 4 1 2 3 2 3 1 1 3 7 2 1 5 ```

Output:

``` 2 ```
