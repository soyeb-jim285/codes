CSES - Flight Route Requests

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ cities with airports but no flight connections. You are given
$m$ requests which routes should be possible to travel.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of one-way flight connections
which makes it possible to fulfil all requests.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of cities and
requests. The cities are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $m$ lines describing the requests. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: there has to be a route from city $a$ to city $b$. Each
request is unique.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of flight connections.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a, b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 5 1 2 2 3 2 4 3 1 3 4 ```

Output:

``` 4 ```

Explanation: You can create the connections $1 \rightarrow 2$, $2 \rightarrow
3$, $2 \rightarrow 4$ and $3 \rightarrow 1$. Then you can also fly from city
$3$ to city $4$ using the route $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4$.
