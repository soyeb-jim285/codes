CSES - Flight Routes

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to find the $k$ shortest flight routes from Syrjälä to Metsälä. A
route can visit the same city several times.

Note that there can be several routes with the same price and each of them
should be considered (see the example).

# Input

The first input line has three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$: the number of
cities, the number of flights, and the parameter $k$. The cities are numbered
$1,2,\ldots,n$. City 1 is Syrjälä, and city $n$ is Metsälä.

After this, the input has $m$ lines describing the flights. Each line has
three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$: a flight begins at city $a$, ends at city
$b$, and its price is $c$. All flights are one-way flights.

You may assume that there are at least $k$ distinct routes from Syrjälä to
Metsälä.

# Output

Print $k$ integers: the prices of the $k$ cheapest routes sorted according to
their prices.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$
  * $1 \le c \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le k \le 10$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 6 3 1 2 1 1 3 3 2 3 2 2 4 6 3 2 8 3 4 1 ```

Output:

``` 4 4 7 ```

Explanation: The cheapest routes are $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4$ (price
$4$), $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4$ (price $4$) and $1
\rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4$ (price $7$).
