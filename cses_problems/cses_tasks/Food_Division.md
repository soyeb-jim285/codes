CSES - Food Division

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ children around a round table. For each child, you know the
amount of food they currently have and the amount of food they want. The total
amount of food in the table is correct.

At each step, a child can give one unit of food to his or her neighbour. What
is the minimum number of steps needed?

# Input

The first input line contains an integer $n$: the number of children.

The next line has $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$: the current amount of
food for each child.

The last line has $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$: the required amount of
food for each child.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of steps.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $0 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 3 5 0 2 4 2 ```

Output:

``` 2 ```

Explanation: Child 1 gives one unit of food to child 3, and child 2 gives one
unit of food to child 3.
