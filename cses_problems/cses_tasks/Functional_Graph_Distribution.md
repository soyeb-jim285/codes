CSES - Functional Graph Distribution

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A _functional graph_ is a directed graph where each node has outdegree $1$.
For example, here is a functional graph that has $9$ nodes and $2$ components:
![](/file/39a5e727e368197cdce7593736c5cfd1abf75b6439c0823e27c671ff10662377)
Given $n$, your task is to calculate for each $k=1 \dots n$ the number of
functional graphs that have $n$ nodes and $k$ components.

# Input

The only input line has an integer $n$: the number of nodes.

# Output

Print $n$ lines: for each $k=1 \dots n$ the number of graphs modulo $10^9+7$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 5000$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 ```

Output:

``` 17 9 1 ```
