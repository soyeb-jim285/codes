CSES - Graph Girth

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an undirected graph, your task is to determine its _girth_ , i.e., the
length of its shortest cycle.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of nodes and
edges. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $m$ lines describing the edges. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.

You may assume that there is at most one edge between each two nodes.

# Output

Print one integer: the girth of the graph. If there are no cycles, print $-1$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2500$
  * $1 \le m \le 5000$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 6 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 4 4 5 ```

Output:

``` 3 ```
