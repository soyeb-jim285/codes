CSES - Graph Paths II

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Consider a directed weighted graph having $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. Your task
is to calculate the minimum path length from node $1$ to node $n$ with exactly
$k$ edges.

# Input

The first input line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$: the number of
nodes and edges, and the length of the path. The nodes are numbered
$1,2,\dots,n$.

Then, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line contains three
integers $a$, $b$ and $c$: there is an edge from node $a$ to node $b$ with
weight $c$.

# Output

Print the minimum path length. If there are no such paths, print $-1$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 100$
  * $1 \le m \le n(n-1)$
  * $1 \le k \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$
  * $1 \le c \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 4 8 1 2 5 2 3 4 3 1 1 3 2 2 ```

Output:

``` 27 ```
