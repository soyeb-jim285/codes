  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A Gray code is a list of all $2^n$ bit strings of length $n$, where any two
successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is
one).

Your task is to create a Gray code for a given length $n$.

# Input

The only input line has an integer $n$.

# Output

Print $2^n$ lines that describe the Gray code. You can print any valid
solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 16$

# Example

Input:

``` 2 ```

Output:

``` 00 01 11 10 ```
