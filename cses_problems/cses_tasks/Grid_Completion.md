CSES - Grid Completion

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to create an $n \times n$ grid whose each row and column has
exactly one A and B. Some of the characters have already been placed. In how
many ways can you complete the grid?

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of the grid.

After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the grid. Each line has $n$
characters: `.` means an empty square, and `A` and `B` show the characters
already placed.

You can assume that every row and column has at most one A and B.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of ways modulo $10^9+7$.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 500$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 ..... ..AB. ..... B.... ...A. ```

Output:

``` 16 ```
