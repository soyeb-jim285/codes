CSES - Grid Path Construction

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an $n \times m$ grid and two squares $a=(y_1,x_1)$ and $b=(y_2,x_2)$,
create a path from $a$ to $b$ that visits each square exactly once.

For example, here is a path from $a=(1,3)$ to $b=(3,6)$ in a $4 \times 7$
grid:
![](/file/944079e41a17eca6debb54a7d4da8f9124232206a1d80256432e8a2715c00055)

# Input

The first input line has an integer $t$: the number of tests.

After this, there are $t$ lines that describe the tests. Each line has six
integers $n$, $m$, $y_1$, $x_1$, $y_2$ and $x_2$.

In all tests $1 \le y_1,y_2 \le n$ and $1 \le x_1,x_2 \le m$. In addition,
$y_1 \neq y_2$ or $x_1 \neq x_2$.

# Output

Print YES, if it is possible to construct a path, and NO otherwise.

If there is a path, also print its description which consists of characters
`U` (up), `D` (down), `L` (left) and `R` (right). If there are several paths,
you can print any of them.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le t \le 100$
  * $1 \le n \le 50$
  * $1 \le m \le 50$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 2 1 3 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 4 7 1 3 3 6 ```

Output:

``` YES RR NO NO YES RDL YES RRRRDDDLLLLLLUUURDDRURDRURD ```
