CSES - Grundy's Game

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There is a heap of $n$ coins and two players who move alternately. On each
move, a player chooses a heap and divides into two nonempty heaps that have a
different number of coins. The player who makes the last move wins the game.

Your task is to find out who wins if both players play optimally.

# Input

The first input line contains an integer $t$: the number of tests.

After this, there are $t$ lines that describe the tests. Each line has an
integer $n$: the number of coins in the initial heap.

# Output

For each test case, print "first" if the first player wins the game and
"second" if the second player wins the game.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le t \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 6 7 8 ```

Output:

``` first second first ```
