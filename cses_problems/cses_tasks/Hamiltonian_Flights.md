CSES - Hamiltonian Flights

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ cities and $m$ flight connections between them. You want to
travel from Syrjälä to Lehmälä so that you visit each city exactly once. How
many possible routes are there?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of cities and
flights. The cities are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$. City $1$ is Syrjälä, and city
$n$ is Lehmälä.

Then, there are $m$ lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers
$a$ and $b$: there is a flight from city $a$ to city $b$. All flights are one-
way flights.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of routes modulo $10^9+7$.

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 20$
  * $1 \le m \le n^2$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 6 1 2 1 3 2 3 3 2 2 4 3 4 ```

Output:

``` 2 ```
