CSES - High Score

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You play a game consisting of $n$ rooms and $m$ tunnels. Your initial score is
$0$, and each tunnel increases your score by $x$ where $x$ may be both
positive or negative. You may go through a tunnel several times.

Your task is to walk from room $1$ to room $n$. What is the maximum score you
can get?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of rooms and
tunnels. The rooms are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

Then, there are $m$ lines describing the tunnels. Each line has three integers
$a$, $b$ and $x$: the tunnel starts at room $a$, ends at room $b$, and it
increases your score by $x$. All tunnels are one-way tunnels.

You can assume that it is possible to get from room $1$ to room $n$.

# Output

Print one integer: the maximum score you can get. However, if you can get an
arbitrarily large score, print $-1$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2500$
  * $1 \le m \le 5000$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$
  * $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 5 1 2 3 2 4 -1 1 3 -2 3 4 7 1 4 4 ```

Output:

``` 5 ```
