CSES - Houses and Schools

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ houses on a street, numbered $1,2,\dots,n$. The distance of
houses $a$ and $b$ is $|a-b|$. You know the number of children in each house.

Your task is to establish $k$ schools in such a way that each school is in
some house. Then, each child goes to the nearest school. What is the minimum
total walking distance of the children if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $k$: the number of houses and
the number of schools. The houses are numbered $1,2\dots,n$.

After this, there are $n$ integers $c_1,c_2,\dots,c_n$: the number of children
in each house.

# Output

Print the minimum total distance.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le k \le n \le 3000$
  * $1 \le c_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 6 2 2 7 1 4 6 4 ```

Output:

``` 11 ```

Explanation: Houses 2 and 5 will have schools.
