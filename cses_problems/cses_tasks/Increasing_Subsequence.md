CSES - Increasing Subsequence

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an array containing $n$ integers. Your task is to determine the
longest increasing subsequence in the array, i.e., the longest subsequence
where every element is larger than the previous one.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting
some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

# Input

The first line contains an integer $n$: the size of the array.

After this there are $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$: the contents of the
array.

# Output

Print the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le x_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 8 7 3 5 3 6 2 9 8 ```

Output:

``` 4 ```
