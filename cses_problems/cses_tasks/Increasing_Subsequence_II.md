CSES - Increasing Subsequence II

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an array of $n$ integers, your task is to calculate the number of
increasing subsequences it contains. If two subsequences have the same values
but in different positions in the array, they are counted separately.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of the array.

The second line has $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$: the contents of the
array.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of increasing subsequences modulo $10^9+7$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le x_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 2 1 3 ```

Output:

``` 5 ```

Explanation: The increasing subsequences are $[2]$, $[1]$, $[3]$, $[2,3]$ and
$[1,3]$.
