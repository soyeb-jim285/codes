CSES - Inversion Probability

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

An array has $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$, and each of them has been
randomly chosen between $1$ and $r_i$. An inversion is a pair $(a,b)$ where
$a<b$ and $x_a>x_b$.

What is the expected number of inversions in the array?

# Input

The first input line contains an integer $n$: the size of the array.

The second line contains $n$ integers $r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n$: the range of
possible values for each array position.

# Output

Print the expected number of inversions rounded to six decimal places
(rounding half to even).

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 100$
  * $1 \le r_i \le 100$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 5 2 7 ```

Output:

``` 1.057143 ```
