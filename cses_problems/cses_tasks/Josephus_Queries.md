  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s

Consider a game where there are $n$ children (numbered $1,2,\dots,n$) in a
circle. During the game, every second child is removed from the circle, until
there are no children left.

Your task is to process $q$ queries of the form: "when there are $n$ children,
who is the $k$th child that will be removed?"

# Input

The first input line has an integer $q$: the number of queries.

After this, there are $q$ lines that describe the queries. Each line has two
integers $n$ and $k$: the number of children and the position of the child.

# Output

Print $q$ integers: the answer for each query.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le q \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le k \le n \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 7 1 7 3 2 2 1337 1313 ```

Output:

``` 2 6 1 1107 ```
