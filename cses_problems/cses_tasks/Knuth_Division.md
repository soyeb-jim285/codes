CSES - Knuth Division

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an array of $n$ numbers, your task is to divide it into $n$ subarrays,
each of which has a single element.

On each move, you may choose any subarray and split it into two subarrays. The
cost of such a move is the sum of values in the chosen subarray.

What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the array size. The array elements
are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The second line has $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$: the contents of the
array.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum total cost.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 5000$
  * $1 \le x_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 2 7 3 2 5 ```

Output:

``` 43 ```
