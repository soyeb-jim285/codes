CSES - Labyrinth

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a map of a labyrinth, and your task is to find a path from start
to end. You can walk left, right, up and down.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the height and width of the
map.

Then there are $n$ lines of $m$ characters describing the labyrinth. Each
character is `.` (floor), `#` (wall), `A` (start), or `B` (end). There is
exactly one `A` and one `B` in the input.

# Output

First print "YES", if there is a path, and "NO" otherwise.

If there is a path, print the length of the shortest such path and its
description as a string consisting of characters `L` (left), `R` (right), `U`
(up), and `D` (down). You can print any valid solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n,m \le 1000$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 8 ######## #.A#...# #.##.#B# #......# ######## ```

Output:

``` YES 9 LDDRRRRRU ```
