CSES - List of Sums

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

List $A$ consists of $n$ positive integers, and list $B$ contains the sum of
each element pair of list $A$.

For example, if $A=[1,2,3]$, then $B=[3,4,5]$, and if $A=[1,3,3,3]$, then
$B=[4,4,4,6,6,6]$.

Given list $B$, your task is to reconstruct list $A$.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of list $A$.

The next line has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ integers: the contents of list $B$.

You can assume that there is a list $A$ that corresponds to the input, and
each value in $A$ is between $1 \dots k$.

# Output

Print $n$ integers: the contents of list $A$.

You can print the values in any order. If there are more than one solution,
you can print any of them.

# Constraints

  * $3 \le n \le 100$
  * $1 \le k \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 ```

Output:

``` 1 3 3 3 ```

Explanation: In this case list $A$ can be either $[1,3,3,3]$ or $[2,2,2,4]$
and both solutions are accepted.
