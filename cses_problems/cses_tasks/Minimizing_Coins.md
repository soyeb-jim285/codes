CSES - Minimizing Coins

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Consider a money system consisting of $n$ coins. Each coin has a positive
integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money $x$ using the available
coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are $\\{1,5,7\\}$ and the desired sum is $11$, an
optimal solution is $5+5+1$ which requires $3$ coins.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $x$: the number of coins and the
desired sum of money.

The second line has $n$ distinct integers $c_1,c_2,\dots,c_n$: the value of
each coin.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to
produce the desired sum, print $-1$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 100$
  * $1 \le x \le 10^6$
  * $1 \le c_i \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 11 1 5 7 ```

Output:

``` 3 ```
