CSES - Minimum Euclidean Distance

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given a set of points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to find the
minimum Euclidean distance between two distinct points.

The Euclidean distance of points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is
$\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of points.

After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the points. Each line has two
integers $x$ and $y$. You may assume that each point is distinct.

# Output

Print one integer: $d^2$ where $d$ is the minimum Euclidean distance (this
ensures that the result is an integer).

# Constraints

  * $2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $-10^9 \le x,y \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 2 1 4 4 1 2 6 3 ```

Output:

``` 2 ```
