CSES - Monster Game I

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are playing a game that consists of $n$ levels. Each level has a monster.
On levels $1,2,\dots,n-1$, you can either kill or escape the monster. However,
on level $n$ you must kill the final monster to win the game.

Killing a monster takes $sf$ time where $s$ is the monster's strength and $f$
is your skill factor (lower skill factor is better). After killing a monster,
you get a new skill factor. What is the minimum total time in which you can
win the game?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $x$: the number of levels and
your initial skill factor.

The second line has $n$ integers $s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n$: each monster's strength.

The third line has $n$ integers $f_1,f_2,\dots,f_n$: your new skill factor
after killing a monster.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum total time to win the game.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le x \le 10^6$
  * $1 \le s_1 \le s_2 \le \dots \le s_n \le 10^6$
  * $x \ge f_1 \ge f_2 \ge \dots \ge f_n \ge 1$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 100 20 30 30 50 90 90 60 20 20 10 ```

Output:

``` 4800 ```

Explanation: The best way to play is to kill the third and fifth monster.
