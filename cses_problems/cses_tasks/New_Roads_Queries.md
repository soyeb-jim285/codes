CSES - New Roads Queries

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ cities in Byteland but no roads between them. However, each day,
a new road will be built. There will be a total of $m$ roads.

Your task is to process $q$ queries of the form: "after how many days can we
travel from city $a$ to city $b$ for the first time?"

# Input

The first input line has three integers $n$, $m$ and $q$: the number of
cities, roads and queries. The cities are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are $m$ lines that describe the roads in the order they are
built. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$: there will be a road between
cities $a$ and $b$.

Finally, there are $q$ lines that describe the queries. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: we want to travel from city $a$ to city $b$.

# Output

For each query, print the number of days, or $-1$ if it is never possible.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n, m, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 4 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 5 1 3 3 4 3 5 ```

Output:

``` 2 -1 4 ```
