CSES - Planets Cycles

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are playing a game consisting of $n$ planets. Each planet has a teleporter
to another planet (or the planet itself).

You start on a planet and then travel through teleporters until you reach a
planet that you have already visited before.

Your task is to calculate for each planet the number of teleportations there
would be if you started on that planet.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of planets. The planets
are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The second line has $n$ integers $t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n$: for each planet, the
destination of the teleporter. It is possible that $t_i=i$.

# Output

Print $n$ integers according to the problem statement.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le t_i \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 2 4 3 1 4 ```

Output:

``` 3 3 1 3 4 ```
