  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given $k$ distinct prime numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$ and an integer
$n$.

Your task is to calculate how many of the first $n$ positive integers are
divisible by at least one of the given prime numbers.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $k$.

The second line has $k$ prime numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$.

# Output

Print one integer: the number integers within the interval $1,2,\ldots,n$ that
are divisible by at least one of the prime numbers.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^{18}$
  * $1 \le k \le 20$
  * $2 \le a_i \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 20 2 2 5 ```

Output:

``` 12 ```

Explanation: the $12$ numbers are $2,4,5,6,8,10,12,14,15,16,18,20$.
