CSES - Range Queries and Copies

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to maintain a list of arrays which initially has a single array.
You have to process the following types of queries:

  1. Set the value $a$ in array $k$ to $x$.
  2. Calculate the sum of values in range $[a,b]$ in array $k$.
  3. Create a copy of array $k$ and add it to the end of the list.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $q$: the array size and the
number of queries.

The next line has $n$ integers $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$: the initial contents of
the array.

Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. The format of each line
is one of the following: "1 $k$ $a$ $x$", "2 $k$ $a$ $b$" or "3 $k$".

# Output

Print the answer to each sum query.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le t_i, x \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le a \le b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 6 2 3 1 2 5 3 1 2 1 1 5 2 2 1 5 1 2 2 5 2 1 1 5 2 2 1 5 ```

Output:

``` 13 13 13 15 ```
