CSES - Reachable Nodes

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A directed acyclic graph consists of $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. The nodes are
numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

Calculate for each node the number of nodes you can reach from that node
(including the node itself).

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of nodes and
edges.

Then there are $m$ lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct
integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge from node $a$ to node $b$.

# Output

Print $n$ integers: for each node the number of reachable nodes.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$
  * $1 \le m \le 10^5$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 6 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 3 5 4 5 ```

Output:

``` 5 3 2 2 1 ```
