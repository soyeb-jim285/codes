There is a list of $n$ numbers and two players who move alternately. On each
move, a player removes either the first or last number from the list, and
their score increases by that number. Both players try to maximize their
scores.

What is the maximum possible score for the first player when both players play
optimally?

# Output

Print the maximum possible score for the first player.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 5000$
  * $-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9$
