  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A repeating substring is a substring that occurs in two (or more) locations in
the string. Your task is to find the longest repeating substring in a given
string.

# Input

The only input line has a string of length $n$ that consists of characters
a–z.

# Output

Print the longest repeating substring. If there are several possibilities, you
can print any of them. If there is no repeating substring, print $-1$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$

# Example

Input:

``` cabababc ```

Output:

``` abab ```
