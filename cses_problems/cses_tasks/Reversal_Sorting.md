CSES - Reversal Sorting

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You have an array that contains a permutation of integers $1,2,\dots,n$. Your
task is to sort the array in increasing order by reversing subarrays. You can
construct any solution that has at most $n$ reversals.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of the array. The array
elements are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The next line has $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$: the contents of the array.

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the number of reversals.

After that, print $k$ lines that describe the reversals. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: you reverse a subarray from position $a$ to position
$b$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$

# Example

Input:

``` 4 2 3 1 4 ```

Output:

``` 2 1 3 2 3 ```
