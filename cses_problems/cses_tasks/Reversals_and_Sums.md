CSES - Reversals and Sums

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an array of $n$ integers, you have to process following operations:

  1. reverse a subarray
  2. calculate the sum of values in a subarray

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the size of the array and
the number of operations. The array elements are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The next line as $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$: the contents of the array.

Finally, there are $m$ lines that describe the operations. Each line has three
integers $t$, $a$ and $b$. If $t=1$, you should reverse a subarray from $a$ to
$b$. If $t=2$, you should calculate the sum of values from $a$ to $b$.

# Output

Print the answer to each operation where $t=2$.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 10^5$
  * $0 \le x_i \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le a \le b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 8 3 2 1 3 4 5 3 4 4 2 2 4 1 3 6 2 2 4 ```

Output:

``` 8 9 ```
