CSES - School Dance

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ boys and $m$ girls in a school. Next week a school dance will be
organized. A dance pair consists of a boy and a girl, and there are $k$
potential pairs.

Your task is to find out the maximum number of dance pairs and show how this
number can be achieved.

# Input

The first input line has three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$: the number of boys,
girls, and potential pairs. The boys are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$, and the girls
are numbered $1,2,\dots,m$.

After this, there are $k$ lines describing the potential pairs. Each line has
two integers $a$ and $b$: boy $a$ and girl $b$ are willing to dance together.

# Output

First print one integer $r$: the maximum number of dance pairs. After this,
print $r$ lines describing the pairs. You can print any valid solution.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n,m \le 500$
  * $1 \le k \le 1000$
  * $1 \le a \le n$
  * $1 \le b \le m$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 2 4 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 1 ```

Output:

``` 2 1 2 3 1 ```
