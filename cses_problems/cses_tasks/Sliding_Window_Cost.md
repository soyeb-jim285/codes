CSES - Sliding Window Cost

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an array of $n$ integers. Your task is to calculate for each
window of $k$ elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making
all elements equal.

You can increase or decrease each element with cost $x$ where $x$ is the
difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum
of such costs.

# Input

The first input line contains two integers $n$ and $k$: the number of elements
and the size of the window.

Then there are $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$: the contents of the array.

# Output

Output $n-k+1$ values: the costs.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le x_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 8 3 2 4 3 5 8 1 2 1 ```

Output:

``` 2 2 5 7 7 1 ```
