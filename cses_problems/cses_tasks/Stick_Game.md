CSES - Stick Game

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Consider a game where two players remove sticks from a heap. The players move
alternately, and the player who removes the last stick wins the game.

A set $P=\\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_k\\}$ determines the allowed moves. For example,
if $P=\\{1,3,4\\}$, a player may remove $1$, $3$ or $4$ sticks.

Your task is find out for each number of sticks $1,2,\dots,n$ if the first
player has a winning or losing position.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $k$: the number of sticks and
moves.

The next line has $k$ integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$ that describe the allowed
moves. All integers are distinct, and one of them is $1$.

# Output

Print a string containing $n$ characters: `W` means a winning position, and
`L` means a losing position.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^6$
  * $1 \le k \le 100$
  * $1 \le p_i \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 10 3 1 3 4 ```

Output:

``` WLWWWWLWLW ```
