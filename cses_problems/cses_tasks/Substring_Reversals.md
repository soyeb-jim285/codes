CSES - Substring Reversals

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given a string, your task is to process operations where you reverse a
substring of the string. What is the final string after all the operations?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the length of the string
and the number of operations. The characters of the string are numbered
$1,2,\dots,n$.

The next line has a string of length $n$ that consists of characters A–Z.

Finally, there are $m$ lines that describe the operations. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $b$: you reverse a substring from position $a$ to position
$b$.

# Output

Print the final string after all the operations.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a \le b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 7 2 AYBABTU 3 4 4 7 ```

Output:

``` AYAUTBB ```
