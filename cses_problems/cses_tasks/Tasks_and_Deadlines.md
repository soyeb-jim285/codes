CSES - Tasks and Deadlines

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You have to process $n$ tasks. Each task has a duration and a deadline, and
you will process the tasks in some order one after another. Your reward for a
task is $d-f$ where $d$ is its deadline and $f$ is your finishing time. (The
starting time is $0$, and you have to process all tasks even if a task would
yield negative reward.)

What is your maximum reward if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of tasks.

After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the tasks. Each line has two
integers $a$ and $d$: the duration and deadline of the task.

# Output

Print one integer: the maximum reward.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,d \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

``` 3 6 10 8 15 5 12 ```

Output:

``` 2 ```
