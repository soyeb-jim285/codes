using them. Whenever two cubes are one on top of the other, the upper cube
must be smaller than the lower cube.

You must process the cubes in the given order. You can always either place the
cube on top of an existing tower, or begin a new tower. What is the minimum
possible number of towers?

cubes.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of towers.

# Constraints
