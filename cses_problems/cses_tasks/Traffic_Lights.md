CSES - Traffic Lights

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There is a street of length $x$ whose positions are numbered $0,1,\ldots,x$.
Initially there are no traffic lights, but $n$ sets of traffic lights are
added to the street one after another.

Your task is to calculate the length of the longest passage without traffic
lights after each addition.

# Input

The first input line contains two integers $x$ and $n$: the length of the
street and the number of sets of traffic lights.

Then, the next line contains $n$ integers $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$: the position
of each set of traffic lights. Each position is distinct.

# Output

Print the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each
addition.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le x \le 10^9$
  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $0 < p_i < x$

# Example

Input:

``` 8 3 3 6 2 ```

Output:

``` 5 3 3 ```
