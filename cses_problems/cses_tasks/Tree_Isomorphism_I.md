CSES - Tree Isomorphism I

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given two rooted trees, your task is to find out if they are _isomorphic_ ,
i.e., it is possible to draw them so that they look the same.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $t$: the number of tests. Then, there are
$t$ tests described as follows:

The first line has an integer $n$: the number of nodes in both trees. The
nodes are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$, and node $1$ is the root.

Then, there are $n-1$ lines describing the edges of the first tree, and
finally $n-1$ lines describing the edges of the second tree.

# Output

For each test, print "YES", if the trees are isomorphic, and "NO" otherwise.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le t \le 1000$
  * $2 \le n \le 10^5$
  * the sum of all values of $n$ is at most $10^5$

# Example

Input:

``` 2 3 1 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 3 2 ```

Output:

``` NO YES ```
