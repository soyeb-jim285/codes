CSES - Tree Matching

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a tree consisting of $n$ nodes.

A _matching_ is a set of edges where each node is an endpoint of at most one
edge. What is the maximum number of edges in a matching?

# Input

The first input line contains an integer $n$: the number of nodes. The nodes
are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.

Then there are $n-1$ lines describing the edges. Each line contains two
integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.

# Output

Print one integer: the maximum number of pairs.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 ```

Output:

``` 2 ```

Explanation: One possible matching is $(1,2)$ and $(3,4)$.
