CSES - Tree Traversals

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are three common ways to traverse the nodes of a binary tree:

  * _Preorder_ : First process the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
  * _Inorder_ : First process the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
  * _Postorder_ : First process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.

There is a binary tree of $n$ nodes with distinct labels. You are given the
preorder and inorder traversals of the tree, and your task is to determine its
postorder traversal.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of nodes. The nodes are
numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

After this, there are two lines describing the preorder and inorder traversals
of the tree. Both lines consist of $n$ integers.

You can assume that the input corresponds to a binary tree.

# Output

Print the postorder traversal of the tree.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 5 3 2 1 4 3 5 1 2 4 ```

Output:

``` 3 1 4 2 5 ```
