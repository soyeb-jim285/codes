CSES - Visiting Cities

  * **Time limit:** 1.00 s
  * **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You want to travel from Syrjälä to Lehmälä by plane using a minimum-price
route. Which cities will you certainly visit?

# Input

The first input line contains two integers $n$ and $m$: the number of cities
and the number of flights. The cities are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$. City 1 is
Syrjälä, and city $n$ is Lehmälä.

After this, there are $m$ lines describing the flights. Each line has three
integers $a$, $b$, and $c$: there is a flight from city $a$ to city $b$ with
price $c$. All flights are one-way flights.

You may assume that there is a route from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the number of cities that are certainly in the
route. After this, print the $k$ cities sorted in increasing order.

# Constraints

  * $1 \le n \le 10^5$
  * $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
  * $1 \le a,b \le n$
  * $1 \le c \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

``` 5 6 1 2 3 1 3 4 2 3 1 2 4 5 3 4 1 4 5 8 ```

Output:

``` 4 1 3 4 5 ```
